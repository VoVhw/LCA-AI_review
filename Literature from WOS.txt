ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB The shipping industry's reliance on fossil fuels significantly contributes to increased greenhouse gas emissions, which is a global issue. Thus, to reduce these emissions, the International Maritime Organization has developed numerous regulations and technical measures. However, these rely on simple estimates derived from ship types and fuel consumption, without considering detailed external conditions. This case study develops a predictive model for carbon dioxide emissions from the exhaust gases of a ship during actual operation using statistical methods based on the telegraph modes of its speed. The results are compared and analyzed with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) simulation outcomes. The developed predictive model and LCA simulation results confirmed that carbon dioxide emission amounts increase as revolutions per minute rise across various telegraph modes. This result indicates a corresponding increase in fuel consumption. The model predicted levels approximately 83% higher than those obtained from LCA simulations. These differences occurred due to a failure to consider factors such as engine characteristics and external forces acting on the ship in LCA simulations. Furthermore, this study applies ANCOVA analysis to examine the predictive model and LCA simulation trends, confirming that the groups' trends were statistically equal. Despite a quantitative difference between the actual outcomes based on the predictive model and LCA simulation, the latter still provides a suitable and quick way to analyze different case types to make sustainable choices.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become the prevalent approach for quantifying the environmental impact of products over their entire life cycle. Unfortunately, LCA studies require large amounts of data that are difficult to collect in practice, which makes them expensive and time consuming. This work introduces a method that simplifies standard LCA studies by using proxy metrics that are identified following a systematic approach. Our method, which combines multi-linear regression and mixed-integer linear programming, builds in an automatic manner simplified multi-linear regression models of impact that predict (with high accuracy) the damage in different environmental categories from a reduced number of proxy metrics. Our approach was applied to data retrieved from ecoinvent. Numerical results show that few indicators suffice to describe the environmental performance of a process with high accuracy. Our findings will help develop general guidelines for simplified LCA studies that will focus on quantifying a reduced number of key indicators. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In large-scale educational surveys, a latent regression model is used to compensate for the shortage of cognitive information. Conventionally, the covariates in the latent regression model are principal components extracted from background data. This operational method has several important disadvantages, such as the handling of missing data and the high model complexity. The approach introduced here to identify multiple groups that can account for the variation among students is to conduct a latent class analysis (LCA). In the LCA, one or more latent nominal variables are identified that can be used to classify respondents with respect to their background characteristics. These classifications are then introduced as predictors in the latent regression. The primary goal of this study was to explore whether this approach yields similar estimates of group means and standard deviations compared with the operational procedure. The alternative approaches based on LCA differed regarding the number of classes, the items used for the LCA, and whether manifest class membership information or class membership probabilities were used as independent variables in the latent regression. Overall, recovery of the operational approach's group means and standard deviations was very satisfactory for all LCA approaches. Furthermore, the posterior means and standard deviations used to generate plausible values derived from the operational approach and the LCA approaches correlated highly. Thus, incorporating independent variables based on an LCA of background data into the latent regression model appears to be a viable alternative to the operational approach.

AB Background: A high proportion of health care services are persistently utilized by a small subpopulation of patients. To improve clinical outcomes while reducing costs and utilization, population health management programs often provide targeted interventions to patients who may become persistent high users/utilizers (PHUs). Enhanced prediction and management of PHUs can improve health care system efficiencies and improve the overall quality of patient care.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to detect key classes of diseases and medications among the study population and to assess the predictive value of these classes in identifying PHUs.
   Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of insurance claims data of patients from the Johns Hopkins Health Care system. We defined a PHU as a patient incurring health care costs in the top 20% of all patients' costs for 4 consecutive 6-month periods. We used 2013 claims data to predict PHU status in 2014-2015. We applied latent class analysis (LCA), an unsupervised clustering approach, to identify patient subgroups with similar diagnostic and medication patterns to differentiate variations in health care utilization across PHUs. Logistic regression models were then built to predict PHUs in the full population and in select subpopulations. Predictors included LCA membership probabilities, demographic covariates, and health utilization covariates. Predictive powers of the regression models were assessed and compared using standard metrics.
   Results: We identified 164,221 patients with continuous enrollment between 2013 and 2015. The mean study population age was 19.7 years, 55.9% were women, 3.3% had >= 1 hospitalization, and 19.1% had 10+ outpatient visits in 2013. A total of 8359 (5.09%) patients were identified as PHUs in both 2014 and 2015. The LCA performed optimally when assigning patients to four probability disease/medication classes. Given the feedback provided by clinical experts, we further divided the population into four diagnostic groups for sensitivity analysis: acute upper respiratory infection (URI) (n=53,232; 4.6% PHUs), mental health (n=34,456; 12.8% PHUs), otitis media (n=24,992; 4.5% PHUs), and musculoskeletal (n=24,799; 15.5% PHUs). For the regression models predicting PHUs in the full population, the F1-score classification metric was lower using a parsimonious model that included LCA categories (F1=38.62%) compared to that of a complex risk stratification model with a full set of predictors (F1=48.20%). However, the LCA-enabled simple models were comparable to the complex model when predicting PHUs in the mental health and musculoskeletal subpopulations (F1-scores of 48.69% and 48.15%, respectively). F1-scores were lower than that of the complex model when the LCA-enabled models were limited to the otitis media and acute URI subpopulations (45.77% and 43.05%, respectively).
   Conclusions: Our study illustrates the value of LCA in identifying subgroups of patients with similar patterns of diagnoses and medications. Our results show that LCA-derived classes can simplify predictive models of PHUs without compromising predictive accuracy. Future studies should investigate the value of LCA-derived classes for predicting PHUs in other health care settings.

AB This study was conducted to investigate and predict the yield and environmental emissions final score (EEFS) of common carp fish farms in Shushtar county of Khuzestan province. The required data was collected from 115 carp fish farms selected by random sampling using face-to-face questionnaire and interview. The total input energy, the yield, and energy ratio were obtained as 293,127.95 MJ ha(-1), 3389.28 kg ha(-1), and 0.30, respectively. Electricity and feed consumption had the highest contributions to total input energy and environmental emissions. The normalization results showed that the marine aquatic ecotoxicity (MAET) and freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (FAET) had the highest values among all impact categories with 671.50x10(-9) and 152.60x10(-9), respectively. Also, the EEFS was calculated per tons of carp fish as 7793.09 pPt. The comparison of results between the regression model and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) indicated that in prediction of the yield, the accuracy values (R-2) of regression and ANFIS models were 0.87 and 0.99, respectively, while in prediction of EEFS, R-2 of regression and ANFIS models were 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. In total, it was concluded that ANFIS model can predict the yield better than regression model.

AB Life cycle inventory (LCI) data gaps present a crucial challenge in research and development using life cycle assessment (LCA). The present study addresses this challenge by using optimized Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANN's adjustable parameters (i.e. topology and hyperparameters) significantly affect prediction capability. Thus, the optimality of those parameters is of paramount importance. However, performing an optimization on the entire ANN's adjustable parameters is computationally demanding, which may result in an intractable problem. To tackle this challenge, the present study proposes a hybrid approach using heuristics and Genetic Algorithm to systematically design optimal ANNs in a tractable fashion. The proposed approach is then assessed through the prediction of data gaps in the Canadian fuel LCI database, GHGenius (an open-access tool for modeling Canadian fuel pathways). This is achieved using an automation workflow that extracts LCI data from GHGenius at the fuel/province/unit process level. It is found that the resulting optimal ANNs not only are accurate in predicting data to fill CO2-eq emissions data gaps for unit processes present in the Canadian fuel life cycles but also possess shallower hidden topologies. These salient results are ascribed to the impacts of the input layer on the optimal network. In particular, input layers comprised of categorical and numerical features lead to enhancement of network prediction and/or shallower hidden topology for optimal ANNs. Taken altogether, the present study proposes, implements, and validates a systematic framework to tractably design optimal ANNs for predicting data to fill data gaps in LCI databases. In addition, this study quantifies average contributions of each unit process present in the Canadian fuel life cycles, including fossil-based and renewable pathways, to total CO2-eq emissions, which is of particular interest in cut-off analysis.

AB Residential buildings are major contributors to carbon emissions from the building and construction industry. Although previous studies have comprehensively investigated the methods for embodied carbon assessment and proposed measures for carbon reduction, it remains challenging to screen the features and influencing factors of embodied carbon intensities from a statistical perspective. This study explored the characteristics of embodied carbon emissions based on 438 multi-story residential building samples. The influences of building features, such as the number of floors, number of basements, structural form, seismic design requirement, delivery type, and building area, were analyzed using clustering and significance tests. The average embodied carbon intensity was evaluated as 467.6 kg CO2e/m2 and relevant coefficient of variation was approximately 20 %. Further discussion on building material weight, cost, and embodied carbon intensities indicated that a simplified system boundary considering 95 % thresholds of both weight and cost can provide satisfactory results for embodied carbon assessment with relative errors below 3 %. Moreover, three linear models were proposed for predicting embodied carbon intensities. The results showed that the carbon intensities can be predicted based on five types of primary materials with good accuracy. The proposed system boundary, predictive models, and identified characteristics have practical applications for assessing, estimating, and reducing embodied carbon. Accordingly, it is possible to facilitate low-carbon design of multi-story residential buildings.

AB The study conducts a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of precast sandwich panels by integrating operational and embodied phases detailing thermal efficiency and environmental impacts. The analytical regression model is developed for climatic diversity and design variables using the energy rating tool FirstRate5 to compare with a conventional brick veneer construction. LCA is performed on the building information modeling (BIM) platform to connect operational energy and express the relative embodied impacts of insulation constituents, compressive strength, reinforcement, and mix design. Monte Carlo simulation shows significant advantages of concrete sandwich panels in reducing operational H/C loads over building service life. LCA reveals a 100 mm thick external precast concrete wall with 50% fly ash reduces CO2 emission and energy demand by 54.7% and 75.9% consecutively against the benchmark. Moreover, it comprises 84.31% of the total building mass, accountable for only 53.27% of total CO2 emission and 27.25% of energy demand, which is comparatively lower than other materials. In the case of selecting lining insulation, a broader benefit is identified for extruded polystyrene (XPS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS) boards due to their relative weight, thickness, and environmental impacts. Representative equations of energy efficiency and impact assessment will assist in adopting sandwich panels for new construction and refurbishment with relative dimensions.

AB This study aimed to develop a precision model between inputs and yield, and also between inputs (indirect emissions) and environmental final index (EFI) in onion farms through regression models (classic computing) and artificial intelligence models (soft computing). Required data were collected through direct measurement and questionnaire. To this end, 85 and 70 questionnaires were distributed among onion farmers in Fereydan and Falavarjan regions (Isfahan province, center of Iran), respectively. In the Fereydan region, the total energy input, onion yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) were obtained as 239496 MJ.ha(-1), 97658 kg.ha(-1), and 9.08 kg.m(-3), respectively, while for Falavarjan region, these were obtained as 232221 MJ.ha(-1), 94485 kg.ha(-1), and 10.8 kg m(-3), respectively. Electricity and diesel fuel were the most widely used inputs in the study areas. Based on the results related to the environmental indices, EFI was obtained as 547.38 and 363.54 pPt.t(-1) for Fereydan and Falavarjan regions, respectively. The contribution of direct (such as CO2 and NH3) and indirect emissions (especially electricity) to the total EFI was 74 and 26% in Fereydan and 63 and 37% in Falavarjan region, respectively. Results related to the Cobb-Douglas regression model (CDR) showed that the effects of seed, manure, and labor on the onion yield were significant at 1% level of confidence. However, despite meeting the regression assumptions, the CDR model has predicted the yield and EFI with lower accuracy and higher error compared to artificial neural network models (ANNs), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Soft computing (artificial intelligence) modeling showed that the ANFIS model (Grid Partitioning (GP)) has higher computational speed an lower error compared to multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models. Therefore, the comparison of the best GP and MLP models showed that the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) was obtained as 10.649 and 52.321 kg.ha(-1) for yield and 25.08 and 40.94 pPt.ha(-1) for EFI, respectively.

AB In recent years, 3D printing has experienced significant growth in the manufacturing sector due to its ability to produce intricate and customized components. The advent of Industry 4.0 further boosted this progress by seamlessly incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in 3D printing processes. As a result, design precision and production efficiency have significantly improved. Although numerous studies have explored the integration of AI and 3D printing, the literature still lacks a comprehensive overview that emphasizes material selection and formulation, predictive modeling, design optimization, and quality control. To fully understand the impacts of these emerging technologies on advanced manufacturing, a thorough assessment is required. This review aims to examine the intersection of AI and 3D printing to create a technologically advanced and environment-friendly manufacturing environment. It examines factors such as material, process efficiency, and design enhancements to highlight the benefits of combining these technologies. By focusing on predictive modeling, material selection and quality control, this analysis aims to unlock the potential for a sustainable and efficient 3D printing process. This review provided a thorough analysis of the challenges and potential benefits, proving valuable for academics and practitioners alike. It presents solutions that may establish a foundation for sustained growth and outlines a strategy for leveraging 3D printing and AI capabilities in the manufacturing sector.

AB Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) is an open-loop geothermal system allowing long-term storage of thermal energy in groundwater. It is a promising technology for environmentally friendly energy generation that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the literature, there are few studies on the greenhouse gas emissions caused by ATES systems over their entire life cycle. Thus, this study presents a novel life cycle assessment (LCA) regression model that can be used for a wide range of ATES configurations due to its parametric structure. This model is a fast alternative to conventional time-consuming LCAs. Combined with a Monte Carlo simulation, it enables the analysis of the environmental impacts of a large variety of hypothetical ATES systems and therefore the evaluation of the technology as a whole. Compared to conventional heating systems based on heating oil and natural gas, the median value of the Monte Carlo simulation results in GHG savings of up to 74%. In comparison to cooling techniques using today's electricity mix, ATES can save up to about 59% of GHG emissions, while also being economically competitive. When considering a projected electricity mix for the year 2050, the GHG emission savings resulting from a second LCA regression model are as high as 97%. The findings of our sensitivity analysis show which ATES design parameters should be optimized when planning new systems. In particular, the most important design parameters operating time cooling and coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump should be carefully considered.

AB A limitation of any reported environmental performance is the considerable uncertainties present in the analysis. A methodology based on design of experiments techniques, coupled with life cycle assessment, was implemented to investigate the influence of inventory uncertainties on the predicted environmental impact. A case study on nanomanufacturing is presented. Results showed that mass data variability does not have a significant effect on the predicted environmental impacts. Material profiles for input materials did have a highly significant effect on the overall impact. Energy consumption and material characterization were identified as two areas where additional research is needed in order to obtain more accurate and precise predictions of the overall impact of nanomaterials. The methodology facilitates impact assessment of material selection for life cycle assessment, allows the establishment of a predictive model, and makes possible the identification of significant process variables as well as their interdependency.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) plays a crucial role in green manufacturing to uncover the critical aspects for alleviating the environmental burdens due to manufacturing processes. However, the scarcity of life cycle inventory (LCI) data for the manufacturing processes is a considerable challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to extrapolate LCI data of manufacturing processes. Taking advantage of LCI data in the Ecoinvent datasets, decision tree-based supervised machine learning models, namely decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and adaptive boosting, have been developed to extrapolate the data of GHG emissions, i.e., carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, and water vapor. Initially, a correlation analysis was conducted to derive the most influential factors on GHG quantities resulting from manufacturing activities. First, the collected data have been preprocessed and split into train and test sets (70% and 30%, respectively). Second, a five-fold cross-validation method was applied to tune the hyperparameters of the models. Then, the models were re-trained using the best hyperparameters and evaluated using the test set. The results reveal that the Gradient Boosting model has a superior predictive performance for extrapolating the GHG emission data, with average coefficients of determination (R-2) on the test set <0.95. Moreover, the model predictions involve relatively low values of the average root mean squared error and an average mean percentage of error on the test set. The correlation and feature importance analyses emphasized that the workpiece material and manufacturing technology have a considerable effect on natural resource consumption, i.e., energy, material, and water inflows into the process. Meanwhile, energy consumption, water usage, and raw aluminum depletion were the most influential factors in GHG emissions. Eventually, a case study to extrapolate the inflows and the outflows for new manufacturing activities has been conducted using the validated models. The proposed GraBoost model provides a computational supplementary approach to estimate and extrapolate the GHG emissions for different manufacturing processes when LCI data are incomplete or don't exist within LCI databases.

AB Purpose Bottom-up-based life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches are used to assess the greenhouse gas emissions of various products such as transportation fuels. Bottom-up spreadsheet-based models include numerous calculations and assumed values that are uncertain. Currently, most LCAs provide point estimates with a simple one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis, which provides limited insight into how the model assumptions affect the results. Additionally, the LCA models are generally presented with a limited number of scenarios to avoid overwhelming the reader; however, this limits the usefulness of the work, as each reader will be interested in different scenarios. The goal of this work is to use a global sensitivity and regression to provide as much information to the reader as possible in an easily digestible form. Methods The Morris and Sobol global sensitivity methods are examined to determine if they can accurately identify the key inputs that have the largest effect on overall output variance. A multiparameter linear regression is then used to simplify the model into a single equation. Rstudio and Excel VBA are used to create an easy-to-use template called the Regression, Uncertainty, and Sensitivity Tool (RUST) that can be inserted into any Excel-based LCA model. This method is applied to the previously published FUNdamental ENgineering PrinciplEs-based ModeL for Estimation of GreenHouse Gases in Conventional Crude Oils and Oil Sands (FUNNEL-GHG-CCO/OS) as an example case. Results and discussion Both the Morris and Sobol methods can identify the key parameters, but the Morris method requires less than 1/100th as many model evaluations. Of the model's 65 parameters, 14 key parameters were identified. The corresponding regression model was found to have an accuracy of +/- 0.5 g CO2 eq/MJ 90% of the time and a maximum error of + 3 and - 1 g CO2 eq/MJ. Conclusions This work found that the Morris method can be used to screen key parameters and that a stepwise multiparameter linear regression approach can be used to develop a simplified version of the model. The developed RUST Excel workbook can be used to perform the sensitivity and regression analysis of any Excel-based LCA models. The regression model can then be easily published, it does not require a large effort to make a user friendly version of the model, and it conceals confidential data if necessary. The simplified model makes it easy for policy markets to investigate how changes in critical parameters affect the LCA results without having to learn how to use the full complex model.

AB Biochar, formed through slow pyrolysis of biomass, has garnered attention as a pathway to bind atmospheric carbon in products. However, life cycle assessment data for biomass pyrolysis have limitations in data quality, particularly for novel processes. Here, a compositional, predictive model of slow pyrolysis is developed, with a focus on CO2 fluxes and energy products, reflecting mass-weighted cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin pyrolysis products for a given pyrolysis temperature. This model accurately predicts biochar yields and composition within 5 % of experimental values but shows broader distributions for bio-oil and syngas (typically within 20 %). This model is demonstrated on common feedstocks to quantify biochar yield, energy, and CO2 emissions as a function of temperature and produce key life cycle inventory flows (e.g., 0.73 kg CO2/kg poplar biochar bound carbon at 500 degrees C). This model can be adapted to any lignocellulosic biomass to inform development of pyrolysis processes that maximize carbon sequestration.

AB Life cycle assessment plays a critical role in quantifying environmental impacts, but its credibility remains challenged when data and uncertainty analysis are lacking. In this study, we propose a data compilation framework to address these two issues. The framework first quantifies the correlations of production activities among existing data in temporal, geographical, and taxonomic dimensions. The framework then introduces covariance functions to convert these correlations to a similarity matrix, and the Gaussian process regression model is adopted to predict new data based on these covariance functions. The associated uncertainty is automatically characterized using the posterior distribution of predictions. The framework is demonstrated on the nitrogen fertilizer application rate for food production-an activity recognized for its environmental burden-with results capable of reflecting temporal and geographical variations. By introducing the concept of phylogenetic distance as a correlation of taxonomy, the framework provides a quantitative basis for predictions in a proxy data usage scenario. The framework can be used in developing temporally and regionally representative life cycle inventories and databases and can facilitate consistent uncertainty quantification in future life cycle assessment methodologies.

AB This study aims to investigate the influence of various reaction parameters (temperatures, working pressures and reaction time) on biodiesel yields and environmental and economic performance of rapeseed oil transesterification in supercritical methanol. Experiments were carried out in a laboratory-scale batch reactor. Results were statistically analysed and multiple regression models which describe and predict biodiesel yields with high certainty at different reaction conditions were provided. The highest biodiesel yield (93 wt%) was achieved at 350 degrees C and 12 MPa after 15 min of reaction. The lowest direct costs and life cycle environmental impacts (in terms of GHG emissions and fossil energy demand) are achieved at the highest yield due to the lowest oil consumption per unit of biodiesel produced. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that even at significantly lower oil feedstock prices this observation stands firm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The environmental effect of the construction sector has recently drawn attention, leading to research which promotes sustainability. Therefore, different researcher recommends different alternative materials such as fly ash, waste glass red mud and solid waste. Environmental sustainability and mechanical performance are two major concerns in the construction industry. Furthermore, the complex internal relationships between the components of such concrete determine the mix design, which is crucial for attaining the required compressive strength. This study addresses two key issues associated with the current concrete production. First, it uses recycled concrete powder (RCP) as a cement replacement (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) to promote sustainability and the undesirable impact of cement on the environment. Secondly, it proposes a predictive model based on machine learning for the compressive strength of RCP based concrete. A comprehensive dataset containing 270 experimental data points was compiled to train and test various machine learning (ML) models. The experimental results indicated that the optimum RCP mix with 10% replacement, achieved a compressive strength that was 15.8% higher than that of the reference concrete without RCP. Furthermore, scanning electronic microscopy indicates that internal structure improved with RCP due to filling and pozzolanic reaction. ML models indicate that Gradient Boosting was found to be the most precise, exhibiting the highest coefficient of determination with the lowest values for root mean squared error and mean absolute error. These findings provide valuable insights for engineers, contractors, and stakeholders, facilitating enhanced design optimization and promoting the efficient use of resources in concrete construction projects.

AB Material selection significantly affects environmental impacts and other objectives of a product design. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methods are not efficient enough for use at the early design stages to prune a design space. Material properties consist of discrete data sets, which are further complicated when LCA data are included, thus posing a significant challenge in the construction of surrogate models for prediction of all relevant behaviours and numerical optimisation. In this work, we address the unique challenges of material selection in sustainable product design in some important ways. Salient features of the robust surrogate modelling approach include achieving manageable dimensionality of LCA with a minimal loss of the important information by the consolidation of significant factors into categorised groups, as well as subsequent efficiency enhancement by a streamlined process that avoids the construction of full LCA. This approach combines efficiency of use with a mathematically rigorous representation of any pertinent objectives across a design space. To this end, we adapt a two-stage sampling approach in surrogate model construction for sustainability considerations based on a feasible approximation of a Latin Hypercube design at the first stage. The development and implementation of the method are illustrated with the aid of an automotive disc brake design, and the results are discussed in the context of robust optimal material selection in early sustainable product design.

AB The application of functional materials and devices (FM&Ds) underpins numerous products and services, facilitating improved quality of life, but also constitutes a huge environmental burden on the natural ecosystem, prompting the need to quantify their value-chain impact using the bottom-up life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. As the volume of FM&Ds manufactured increases, the LCA calculation speed is constrained due to the time-consuming nature of data collection and processing. Moreover, the bottom-up LCA framework is limited in scope, being typically static or retrospective, and laced with data gap challenges, resulting in the use of proxy values, thus limiting the relevance, accuracy, and quality of results. In this prospective article, we explore how these challenges across all phases of the bottom-up LCA framework can be overcome by harnessing new insights garnered from computationally guided parameterized models enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as machine learning (ML), applicable to all products in general and specifically to FM&Ds, for which adoption remains underexplored.

AB Missing data is the key challenge facing life cycle inventory (LCI) modeling. The collection of missing data can be cost-prohibitive and infeasible in many circumstances. Major strategies to address this issue include proxy selection (i.e., selecting a surrogate dataset to represent the missing data) and data creation (e.g., through empirical equations or mechanistic models). Within these two strategies, we identified three approaches that are widely used for LCI modeling: Data-driven, mechanistic, and future (e.g., 2050) inventory modeling. We critically reviewed the 12 common methods of these three approaches by focusing on their features, scope of application, underlying assumptions, and limitations. These methods were characterized based on the following criteria: "domain knowledge requirement" (both as a method developer and a user), "post-treatment requirement," "challenge in assessing data quality uncertainty," "challenge in generalizability," and "challenge in automation." These criteria can be used by LCA practitioners to select the suitable method(s) to bridge the data gap in LCI modeling, based on the goal and scope of the intended study. We also identified several aspects for future improvement for these reviewed methods.

AB This study aims to quantify the carbon emission intensity of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials to explore its potential in carbon emission reduction. However, comprehensive research on the lifecycle carbon emissions of these materials remains scarce, plagued by issues of data uncertainty, accessibility, and scoping discrepancies. Therefore, a probabilistic lifecycle assessment approach was adopted in this study, enabling un-certainty analysis of the carbon emission intensity of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials. The findings indicate that the 10.5th percentile of the carbon emission intensity simulations for MPC stands at 0.624 kgCO2e/ kg, suggesting that nearly 90% of the values surpass those of OPC, thereby refuting the presumption of its low-carbon attributes. Notably, the consumption and carbon emission factors of magnesium oxide and soluble phosphates emerge as pivotal influences on its carbon emissions. Additionally, a multiple linear regression model was employed to forecast the correlation between the constituents of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials and the volume of carbon emissions. Through this study, we can have a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental performance of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials in terms of carbon emission reduction, which will provide an important support for the selection and design of future green building materials.

AB This study aims to develop a trip energy consumption (TEC) estimation model for the electric bus (EB) fleet planning, operation, and life-cycle assessment. Leveraging the vast variations of temperature in Jilin Province, China, real-world data of 31 EBs operating in 14 months were collected with temperatures fluctuating from -27.0 to 35.0 & DEG;C. TEC of an EB was divided into two parts, which are the energy required by the traction and battery thermal management system, and the energy required by the air conditioner (AC) system operation, respectively. The former was regressed by a logarithmic linear model with ambient temperature, curb weight, travel distance, and trip travel time as contributing factors. The optimum working temperature and regression parameters were obtained by combining Fibonacci and Weighted Least Square. The latter was estimated by the operation time of the AC system in cooling mode or heating mode. Model evaluation and sensitivity analysis were conducted. The results show that: (i) the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the proposed model is 12.108%; (ii) the estimation accuracy of the model has a probability of 99.7814% meeting the requirements of EB fleet scheduling; (iii) the MAPE has a 1.746% reduction if considering passengers' boarding and alighting.

AB Industrial wastes have found great use in the built environment due to the role they play in the sustainable infrastructure development especially in green concrete production. In this research investigation, the impact of wastes from the industry on the compressive strength of concrete incorporating fly ash (FA) and silica fume (SF) as additional components alongside traditional concrete mixes has been studied through the application of machine learning (ML). A green concrete database comprising 330 concrete mix data points has been collected and modelled to estimate the unconfined compressive strength behaviour. Considering the concerning environmental ramifications associated with concrete production and its utilization in construction activities, there is a pressing need to perform predictive model exercise. Furthermore, given the prevalent reliance of concrete production professionals on laboratory experiments, it is imperative to propose smart equations aimed at diminishing this dependency. These equations should be applicable for use in the design, construction, and performance assessment of concrete infrastructure, thereby reflecting the multi-objective nature of this research endeavour. It has been proposed by previous research works that the addition of FA and SF in concrete has a reduction impact on the environmental influence indicators due to reduced cement use. The artificial neural network (ANN) and the M5P models were applied in this exercise to predict the compressive strength of FA- and SF-mixed concrete also considering the impact of water reducing agent in the concrete. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to determine the impact of the concrete components on the strength of the concrete. At the end, closed-form equations were proposed by the ANN and M5P with performance indices which outperformed previous models conducted on the same database size. The result of the sensitivity analysis showed that FA is most impactful of all the studied components thereby emphasizing the importance of adding industrial wastes in concrete production for improved mechanical properties and reduced carbon footprint in the concrete construction activities. Also, the M5P and ANN models with R2 of 0.99 showed a potential for use as decisive models to predict the compressive strength of FA- and SF-mixed concrete.

AB The collection of reliable data is an important and time-consuming part of the life cycle inventory (LCI) phase. Automation of individual steps can help to obtain a higher volume of or more realistic data. The aim of this paper is to survey the current state of automation potential in the scientific literature published between 2008 and 2021, with a focus on LCI in the area of process engineering. The results show that automation was most frequently found in the context of process simulation (via interfaces between software), for LCI database usage (e.g., via using ontologies for linking data) and molecular structure models (via machine learning processes such as artificial neural networks), which were also the categories where the highest level of maturity of the models was reached. No further usage could be observed in the areas of automation techniques for exploiting plant data, scientific literature, process calculation, stoichiometry and proxy data. The open science practice of sharing programming codes, software or other newly created resources was only followed in 20% of cases, uncertainty evaluation was only included in 10 out of 30 papers and only 30% of the developed methods were used in further publication, always including at least one of the first authors. For these reasons, we recommend encouraging exchange in the LCA community and in interdisciplinary settings to foster long-term sustainable development of new automation methodologies supporting data generation.

AB Innovation in digitalization and low-carbon technologies are leading the way for the production sector. In the context of the bioeconomy, a path is opening up for the integration of bio-based processes into the value chain as alternative production schemes to fossil fuel-based production models, although process modeling and optimization is needed as this approach is at an early stage of design and development. The large number of variables in the biorefinery cascade scheme presents the inherent difficulty of the optimization strategy, considering conditions that allow for higher productivity and revenues in parallel with lower environmental burdens. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) through techniques such as machine learning and predictive modeling could be considered as an efficient tool for process optimization. Such techniques require large amounts of historical data to identify effects, synergies and clusters of parameters; detect production anomalies; develop models for predictive, prescriptive or root cause analysis; and provide autonomous control.In this sense, this critical review report aims to provide an overview of available reports that have considered AI for the evaluation of biorefinery production models, identifying its potentialities to enable better production strategies under the principles of sustainability and circular economy. This review aims to be useful for the development of further research on the implementation of digitalization of biorefinery processes. This work aims to identify the forefront innovations in the development of bio-based processes that meet efficiency and sustainability criteria in order to provide information of interest to policy makers, stakeholders and industry professionals.

AB There is a growing demand for sustainable products and systems. Sustainability encompasses environmental, social, and economic aspects, often referred to as the three pillars of sustainability. To make more sustainable design decisions, engineers need tools to predict the environmental, social, and economic impacts of products and navigate potential impact trade-offs. To capture societal adoption of technology, this article uses agentbased modeling (ABM) to predict impacts across all three pillars of sustainability and how to navigate the multidimensional impact trade space. The approach described in this article is based on three main components for the predictive modeling of product impacts and impact trade-space navigation, i) ABM of product adoption, ii) the assessment of product impacts, and iii) an approach for design decisions in the presence of impact trade-offs. The trade-space navigation uses a visual approach to find the non-dominated solutions in the product impact space. To illustrate and describe howto use the method, a case study is presented that predicts the impact of residential solar panels in a region of the United States under various scenarios. The findings of the case study can help policymakers understand suitable implementation strategies for residential solar panels while considering the impact trade-offs involved.

ID GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS
AB The livestock sector is one of the fastest growing subsectors of the agricultural economy and, while it makes a major contribution to global food supply and economic development, it also consumes significant amounts of natural resources and alters the environment. In order to improve our understanding of the global environmental impact of livestock supply chains, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has developed the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model (GLEAM). The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of GLEAM. Specifically, it explains the model architecture, methods and functionality, that is the types of analysis that the model can perform. The model focuses primarily on the quantification of greenhouse gases emissions arising from the production of the 11 main livestock commodities. The model inputs and outputs are managed and produced as raster data sets, with spatial resolution of 0.05 decimal degrees. The Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model v1.0 consists of five distinct modules: (a) the Herd Module; (b) the Manure Module; (c) the Feed Module; (d) the System Module; (e) the Allocation Module. In terms of the modelling approach, GLEAM has several advantages. For example spatial information on livestock distributions and crops yields enables rations to be derived that reflect the local availability of feed resources in developing countries. The Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model also contains a herd model that enables livestock statistics to be disaggregated and variation in livestock performance and management to be captured. Priorities for future development of GLEAM include: improving data quality and the methods used to perform emissions calculations; extending the scope of the model to include selected additional environmental impacts and to enable predictive modelling; and improving the utility of GLEAM output.

AB Most existing life cycle assessment models of waste management have so far underplayed the importance of the waste collection phase, addressing it only in a simplified fashion, either by requesting the total amount of fuel used as a direct user input or by calculating it based on a set of input parameters and fixed diesel consumption factors. However, if the main purpose of the study is to improve the efficiency of the collection system itself, a more detailed analysis of the collection phase is required, avoiding oversimplified and potentially misleading conclusions. The new LCA collection model presented here relies on a large number of parameters (number and type of containers, collection frequency, distances for the various legs of transport, etc.) and allows the detailed predictive analysis of alternative collection scenarios. The results of applying this newly developed model to a number of experimental case studies in Portugal are analyzed, discussed, and compared to those produced by a selection of pre-existing, more simplified models such as ORWARE and MSW-DST. The new model is confirmed as being the most accurate and, importantly, as the only one capable of predicting the consequences of a range of possible changes in the collection parameters.

AB Environmental managers attempt to increasingly incorporate precautionary principles into decision making. The literature lacks Machine Learning -based approaches for forewarning lifecycle environmental impacts. This paper proposes a method to support electric vehicle design. The main innovation of the work lays in merging Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Machine Learning foundations to provide support and awareness to designers. The present approach overcomes the present literature because it provides a method for the design phase, is based on a wellestablished methodology (LCA) and provides quantitative results from little inputs. The approach exploits machine Learning Methods to develop models with the design features of a generic electric vehicle (such as vehicle mass and distance traveled) in six phases (Problem definition; Data collection; Data Preparation; Modeling; Model evaluation; Model interpretation). Differently from existing environmental analyses, all stages of the product life cycle have been considered in building the database; moreover, the model provides quantitative results. Regression models and supervised algorithms were used. The obtained model can be used by product engineers, as well as those not experts on LCA. Moreover, the model guarantees the database and hypothesis 's uniqueness, ensuring the results coherence and comparability. The level of accuracy obtained in the case study (error or 17%) is comparable with studies handling full environmental analysis (that should be more accurate), and outstanding, as the present case is for the design phase. Future works will focus on additional significative indicators, similar electric vehicle design and integration with prospective LCA approaches.

AB The emission of nitrogenous pollution from agricultural lands in form of ammonia volatilization, leaching, runoff, N2O emissions, etc. is still a serious challenge to which agricultural sector faces. In this context, a vast number of decision support systems have been developed and tested to find the best nitrogen application rate. These models are highly dependent on crop simulation models, mathematical and regression models, evolutionary algorithms and artificial intelligent, GIS-based models, etc., while in most cases have ignored to be interfered with regional and national regulations established by experts in the field. In this study, a new framework combining analytical hierarchy (AHP)/modified AHP methods (MAHP) plus metaheuristic optimization techniques has been suggested to find the best nitrogen application rate considering regional capacities and requirements. To reach the objectives of the present study a three yield field experiment was conducted upon which crop yield, nitrogen use efficiency, nitrogen uptake, soil nitrate, ammonia volatilization, N2O emissions, and N leaching were monitored or measured. Using the results from the field experiments and a survey from local experts, the models were developed. AHP-assisted optimization model could cause some biases in the final results due to its intrinsic nature which avoids direct pairwise comparison among indicators (so called sub-criteria) under two different main-criteria. On the contrary, MAHP-assisted model could well reflect the concerns of experts and notably decrease hotspot pollution. Such decision support system can satisfy both farmers and environmentalists' need because of the created high profit and low environmental pollution, while saving resources and ensuring a sustainable production system.

AB There is a growing demand for sustainable products and systems. Sustainability encompasses environmental, social, and economic aspects, often referred to as the three pillars of sustainability. To make more sustainable design decisions, engineers need tools to predict the environmental, social, and economic impacts of products and characterize potential sustainability tradeoffs. To predict the total impact of a product, the quantity of functional units of the product in society and the impact of each product needs to be estimated. This article uses agent-based modeling (ABM), combined with tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA), to predict impacts across all three pillars of sustainability. By using the product impact results, the multidimensional sustainability tradespace can be characterized. The approach described in this article is based on three main components for the predictive modeling of product impacts and the characterization of the sustainability trade space: (i) ABM of product adoption, (ii) the assessment of product impacts, and (iii) an approach for the characterization of product sustainability tradeoffs at the population level. The tradespace characterization uses a Pareto-based method presented visually to find the nondominated solutions in the product impact space. To illustrate and describe how to use the method, a case study is presented that predicts the impact of residential solar panels in a region of the United States under various scenarios. The findings of the case study can help policy makers understand suitable implementation strategies for residential solar panels while considering the impact tradeoffs involved.

AB Eco-efficiency is a key concept encompassing economic and environmental aspects to promote a more efficient use of resources and lower emissions. An eco-efficiency perspective in the design of products and services is thus essential in the pursuit of sustainability. This article proposes a novel decision-support methodological approach to assess the environmental impacts and costs in early design stages, aimed at providing informed recommendations to designers, manufacturers and decision-makers. This multimethodology approach integrates a streamlined life-cycle environmental and cost assessment with a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model that derives eco-efficiency ratios and compares alternative designs, without the need to subjectively weigh the different environmental and cost life-cycle metrics. A linear regression model is then used to indicate the most influential decision variables. This approach was applied to a retrofit process of a historic residential building located in Southern Europe. The metrics used to assess the design parameters are: climate change, acidification, eutrophication, non-renewable primary energy, and net present value. A sensitivity analysis on the decarbonization of the electricity mix was also performed. The multimethodology offers valuable guidance to allow decision-makers to progressively specify the decision variables in an iterative way, using robust methods allowing for the statistical validation of results. The case study revealed robust empirical results for building retrofits in Southern European climates, indicating that the variables that most impact eco-efficiency (in both short and long-term) are roof insulation thickness and material followed by exterior wall insulation material. After three variables specification, the average eco-efficiency always increased, with higher gains obtained for the scenarios with the current electricity mix (22-25% increase) and more modest gains obtained for the electricity decarbonization scenarios (8-15% increase).

This research conducts a critical review to identify design variables affecting the environmental impacts of buildings at three design stages during the design processes. Publications between 2010 and 2022 (inclusive) are examined and 50 papers are selected for review. The results reveal that eight design variables in early design stages, including (1) building aspect ratio, (2) window-to-wall ratio, (3) shading area, (4) building orientation, (5) number of floors, (6) building shape, (7) floor area and (8) floor-to-floor height, have an impact on a building's life-cycle environmental impacts. In detailed design stages, there are four kinds of design variables linked with the environmental impacts of a building: (1) types of building components, (2) sizes of building components, (3) types of building materials, and (4) thickness of building materials. Types of finishing materials are closely related to the environmental impacts of a building in con-struction design stages. The findings of this research help understand the contributors to the environmental impacts of a building from the perspective of building design. The findings also provide a future research di-rection on design variables for making eco-friendly building design.

AB This study tried to clarify the magnitude of CO2 emissions from highway construction and maintenance in China through life cycle assessment (LCA) method. For this, 227 real highway projects constructed from the year 2000 to 2011 in Zhejiang Province, China are classified into six types by two categories of N road (62 projects without grand bridge, great bridge and tunnel) and Y road (165 projects with the same road structures) and three sub-categories of (i) newly constructed road, (ii) replacing pavement road and (iii) full rehabilitated road. Significant influential factors of LCA results were revealed through multivariate linear regression models, combined with data quality assessment and sensitivity analysis. Numerical interval of assessment results indicate that the construction emissions of N highway project are more centralized to no more than 2900 t/lane-km, while Y project have a normal upper boundary of construction CO2 emissions, about 5000 t/lane-km. The contribution of maintenance to CO2 emissions probably could exceed that of newly construction both for Y project and N project. In addition, the pavement replacing and rehabilitation could bring about large amount of CO2 emissions which even match with the CO2 emissions from cumulative traffic volume during highway's life cycle. There are common factors for six categories. Cement and steel are the top largest CO2 emissions contributors and sensitive factors for N road and Y road. The LCA results are not sensitive to the local construction materials but sensitive to the emission factor of diesel used in transportation and on-site construction.

AB Biodiesel has been widely proposed as an alternative to fossil fuels and its environmental impacts have been commonly assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA). However, the results of LCA can be affected by parameter uncertainties. The rigorous treatment of such uncertainties is thus essential to improve decision-making based on the LCA. In this work, the Latin hypercube design of experiments (DOE) approach is proposed for global sensitivity analysis in LCA. In this novel approach, the LCA input parameters are used as the factors for the experimental design. The LCA of biodiesel from different feedstocks, namely, jatropha, waste cooking oil (WCO), and fish oil (FO), under the current conditions in Vietnam was chosen as a test case. The LCA focuses on the global warming potential (GWP), photochemical ozone formation potential (POFP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP) of the biodiesel system. These impact categories were then combined into an overall environmental impact (OEI) score using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The effect of changes in the LCA model parameters on the OEI was then observed through computational experiments using a Latin hypercube design. From the computational experiments, the input parameters significantly affecting the results of LCA were identified, and a proxy polynomial regression model was derived to enable global sensitivity analysis to be performed. The results show that agricultural yield, oil content of jatropha seed, transesterification yield, total transportation, and biodiesel blending fraction are the factors that have significant effects on the OEI of jatropha biodiesel; biodiesel blend fraction and total transportation are significant in the case of WCO diesel, while the only significant effect factor in FO biodiesel case is biodiesel blend fraction. Biodiesel blend fraction is the most significant parameter for all feedstocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The demand for life cycle assessments (LCA) is growing rapidly, which leads to an increasing demand of life cycle inventory (LCI) data. While the LCA community has made significant progress in developing LCI databases for diverse applications, challenges still need to be addressed. This perspective summarizes the current data gaps, transparency, and uncertainty aspects of existing LCI databases. Additionally, we survey and discuss novel techniques for LCI data generation, dissemination, and validation. We propose key future directions for LCI development efforts to address these challenges, including leveraging scientific and technical advances such as the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and blockchain/cloud platforms. Adopting these advanced technologies can significantly improve the quality and accessibility of LCI data, thereby facilitating more accurate and reliable LCA studies.

AB This study analyzes the global warming potential (GWP) of wind power plants within an LCA framework. Therefore, secondary data from studies on wind turbines, which were published in the past 20 years were assessed. The data was categorized into three configurations, i.e. onshore single turbines, onshore wind farms and offshore wind farms. Within a multivariate analysis, featuring a linear regression model approach, the datasets retrieved from the literature were evaluated. The effect variable was the specific GWP, normalized to the function unit gCO2-equ/kWh electricity. Cause variables were (i) the capacity factor, (ii) the rated power and (iii) the annual energy yield (AEY), (iv) the hub height and (v) the rotor diameter. In a secondary part this study showed the quantity of uncertainty, which is present in LCA studies on wind turbines by evaluating generic wind turbine configurations, which were present in the ecoinvent database. Conclusively, a sensitivity analysis on the influence of the capacity factor on the GWP was conducted.
   For onshore single turbines and wind farms a negative correlation was observed between the turbine size and the GWP. A highly significant negative correlation was found between the AEY and the GWP. However, the AEY needed to be log-transformed first. Other cause variables were either collinear to the AEY or showed a weak correlation. For offshore wind turbines similar results could not be presented and none of the cause variable could explain the effect variable. The sample size was however low, as only few studies were conducted for offshore plants.
   The uncertainty analysis showed that generally low uncertainties are present during the modelling phase of the LCA of wind turbines, which suggests that the processes are well understood and documented. The sensitivity analysis on the capacity factor resulted in a non-linear, hyperbolic progression with respect to the GWP. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID ECONOMIC-ASSESSMENT
AB Bio-refineries are promising production options of chemicals production, capable to produce a wide range of fuels and chemicals equivalent to the conventional fossil-based products. To establish bio-refineries as mature choices and achieve the commercialization of their technologies, the application of sustainable solutions during the design and development stages are crucial. The innovative character of bio-based production and therefore data availability and access on process modelling details, is a challenging point for decision makers to move towards this direction.
   Considering the environmental dimension out of the three aspects of sustainability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a suitable methodology for the evaluation of environmental impacts of bio-based processes because it highlights the stages with the greatest impact along a production chain. LCA studies require large amount of information, usually extracted from detailed flowsheets or from already completed pilot plants, making this procedure, costly, time consuming and not practical to act as a decision-support tool for the development of a bio-refinery.
   The aim of this study is to develop predictive models for the assessment of LCA metrics and use them to highlight sustainable design options for bio-refineries. Models require the least possible information, which can be obtained from chemistry -level data or early (conceptual) design stages.
   The modelling techniques used in this study are decision trees and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), due to their easily interpretable structure and high computational capabilities, respectively. Models are based on the extraction of knowledge from a wide dataset for bio-refineries (it refers to 32 products that is, platform chemicals (e.g., syngas, sugars and lignin) and biofuels (e.g., biodiesel, biogas, and alcohols), starting from diverse biomass sources (e.g., wood chips, wheat straw, vegetable oil)). Input parameters include descriptors of the molecular structure and process related data which describe the production path of a study product.
   Models are able to predict LCA metrics which cover the most critical aspects of environmental sustainability such as cumulative energy demand (CED) and Climate Change (CC). The average classification errors for decision-tree models range between 17% (+/- 10%) to 38% (+/- 11%) whereas for ANN models the average R-cv(2) values (coefficient of determination) range between 0.55 (+/- 0.42%) to 0.87 (+/- 0.07%).
   Demonstration of models is provided using case studies found in literature. Models are used to rank options in various design problems and support decisions on the selection of the most profitable option. Examples of such cases are the selection of the appropriate technology or feedstock to produce a desired product or the preliminary design of a biorefinery configuration.
   The proposed approach provides a first generation of models that correlate available and easily accessed information to desirable output process parameters and assessment metrics and can be used as pre-screening tools in the development of innovative processes, ahead of detailed design, thus saving time and money.

AB There is no standard method to predict manure temperature during storage. So, decision support tools, on-farm nutrient cycling models, and life cycle assessment tools to assess the sustainability of agricultural production systems that include manure typically use ambient air temperature as a surrogate for manure temperature. This study explores the application of machine learning algorithms' unique abilities to predict manure temperature based on measured data. The data was collected from two on-farm manure storages (clay pit and concrete tank) instrumented with sensors to acquire manure temperature at various depths during the storage period. The local weather data (ambient air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, relative humidity, and rainfall) were recorded by stations installed at each farm. The data were subjected to four machine learning algorithms gradient boosted trees, bagged tree ensembles, random forest ensembles, and neural networks using the supervised learning approach. The weather data and two additional parameters, time (month) and the manure depth above a sensor, were derived and used as inputs for the machine learning algorithms. Further, the developed machine learning algorithms were challenged with parameters from historical weather data (1990 to 2020) to assess their suitability to predict manure temperature where local weather is not available. The results showed that, in general, the stored manure temperature lagged but followed a similar trend as the ambient air temperature and solar radiation. The average manure temperature was higher than the ambient air temperature for most of the year. Depth influenced the manure temperature; manure in the top layers had a higher temperature during warm periods than the bottom layers, and vice versa during cold seasons. The ensemble models performed better than the neural networks by predicting manure temperatures closer to the measured values and predictions during the scenario analysis. The random forests and bagged tree ensembles were the best performers. Models tended to make better predictions as the depth of manure above a sensor increased. This work will provide added value for developing better decision support tools and models for assessing nutrient cycling on farms. It also informs our knowledge to develop emission mitigation strategies during manure storage, leading to more sustainable manure management practices.

AB We propose the integration of a holistic sustainability assessment framework in computer-aided molecular design (CAMD). The framework enables the assessment of life cycle (LCA) and safety, hazard and environmental (SHE) impacts from cradle-to-gate of chemicals designed through CAMD. It enables the calculation of an overall of 14 sustainability-related indices, with some of them aggregating several impact categories. Lack of models and data gaps in property prediction are addressed systematically through a data mining approach which exploits on-line similarity assessment with existing molecules for which data exist or can be predicted. The framework is implemented both simultaneously with CAMD or after CAMD to assess the designed solvents. A case study is presented on the design of phase-change solvents for chemisorption-based post-combustion CO2 capture. Results indicate that the proposed approach enables the identification of verifiably useful phase-change solvents which exhibit favourable performance trade-offs compared to a reference CO2 capture solvent.

AB The goal of this research is identifying major sources of uncertainty of an environmentally-sustainable urban drainage infrastructure design, based on hydrologic analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA). The uncertainty analysis intends to characterize and compare relative roles of unreliability, incompleteness, technological difference, and spatial and temporal variation in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) data, as well as natural variability in hydrologic data. Uncertainties are analyzed using a robust Monte Carlo simulation approach, performed by High Throughput Computing (HTC) and interpreted by Morse-Scale regression models. The uncertainty analysis platform is applied to a watershed-scale LCA of rainwater harvesting systems (RWH) to control combined sewer overflows (CSOs). To consider the watershed-scale implications, RWH is simulated to serve for both the water supply and CSO control in an urban watershed in Toledo, Ohio, USA. Results suggest that, among the studied parameters, rainfall depth (as a hydrologic parameter) caused more than 86% of the uncertainty, while only 7% of the uncertainty was caused by LCIA parameters. Such an emphasis on the necessity of robust hydrologic data and associated analyses increase the reliability of LCA-based urban water infrastructure design. In addition, results suggest that such a topology-inspired model is capable of rendering an optimal RWH system capacity as a function of annual rainfall depth. Specifically, if the system could capture 1/40th of annual rainfall depth in each event from rooftops, the RWH system would be optimal and, thus, lead to minimized life cycle impacts in terms of global warming potential (GWP) and aquatic eco-toxicity (ETW). This capture depth would be around 2.1 cm for Toledo (given an 85 cm/year rainfall and 200 m(2) typical roof area), which could be achieved through an RWH system with 4.25 m(3) capacity per household, assuming a uniform plan for the entire studied watershed. Capacities smaller than this suggested optimal value would likely result in loss of RWH potable water treatment savings and CSO control benefits, while capacities larger than the optimal would likely incur an excessive wastewater treatment burden and construction phase impacts of RWH systems.

AB Purpose This study aims to minimize the environmental impacts of thermal seawater desalination by optimizing the required fossil fuel mixture. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied to simulate the environmental impacts for each fuel mixture. To prevent mixture designs inherited collinearly from correlating LCA results, fuel mixtures are first sampled prior to conducting LCA and then later optimized using a regression-based methodology to reduce entailed environmental impacts. Method Setting the functional unit to 1 m(3) of desalinated water induces different reference flows of energy requirements depending on the fuels used. Increasing the level of any fuel type within the fuel mixture scenario will cause a decrease in the level of the other fuel type(s) included. An augmented simplex lattice mixture (ASLM) design is applied to indicate correct experimental conditions and to prevent the correlation due to collinearity inherited from the nature of mixture problems. Regression models are formulated to represent life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results in a closed form suitable for response surface methodology (RSM) optimization. An overall composite sustainability index (CSI) is a single index calculated by aggregating and normalizing corresponding LCIA responses of different units, ranges, and scales using the geometric mean-based method. Results and discussion The results indicate that marine sediment ecotoxicity (MSE) is the category most adversely affected by multistage flash distillation (MSF). On a nationwide scale, the LCA optimized results scored a 17% reduction in associated environmental impacts, which corresponds to a 4.2% reduction in the county's carbon footprint and a 62% reduction in MSE while incurring a minor retrofitting cost to desalination facilities. Conclusions High MSE results due to excessive fossil fuel consumption/burning in MSF should gain as much attention as paid toward global warming potential. High MSE entails the risk of having heavy metals entering the food chain. On the other hand, the geometric mean approach is found to be an effective model to aggregate the LCIA results into a single index while avoiding the subjectivity of the value judgment used in LCIA weighting. This approach serves as a unit-free rescaling method that is robust to outliers or large values examined across different LCIA impacts.

AB BackgroundCardiovascular disease (CVD) has become a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although there is also evidence that multifactorial interventions to control blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid profiles can reduce macrovascular complications and mortality in patients with T2DM, the link between these risk factors has not been established. MethodsOn 10 December 2018, 1,920 people in four cities in Anhui Province were included. Latent category analysis (LCA) was used to explore the clustering mode of HRBs (health risk behaviors). The primary exposure was HRBs and exercise and diet interventions, and the primary outcome was CVD and other variables, including zMS, triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), TyG-WC (waist circumference), TyG-BMI, TG/HDL, and cardiovascular health (CVH). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to establish the relationship between HRBs, exercise, diet interventions, and CVD. Moderate analysis and mediation moderation analysis were employed by the PROCESS method to explore the relationship between these variables. Sensitivity analysis explored the robustness of the model. ResultsThe mean age was 57.10 +/- 10.0 years old. Overall, CVD affects approximately 19.9% of all persons with T2DM. Macrovascular complications of T2DM include coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac insufficiency, and cerebrovascular disease. Elderly age (chi(2) = 22.70), no occupation (chi(2) = 20.97), medium and high socioeconomic status (SES) (chi(2) = 19.92), higher level of TyG-WC (chi(2) = 6.60), and higher zMS (chi(2) = 7.59) were correlated with high CVD. Many metabolic indices have shown a connection with T2DM combined with CVD, and there was a dose-response relationship between HRB co-occurrence and clustering of HRBs and zMS; there was a dose-response relationship between multifactorial intervention and CVH. In the mediation moderation analysis, there was an association between HRB, gender, TyG, TyG-BMI, and CVD. From an intervention management perspective, exercise and no diet intervention were more significant with CVD; moreover, there was an association between intervention management, gender, zMS, TyG-WC, TyG-BMI, TG/HDL, and CVD. Finally, there was an association between sex, CVH, and CVD. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that our results were robust. ConclusionsCVD is one of the common complications in patients with type 2 diabetes, and its long-term outcome will have more or less impact on patients. Our findings suggest the potential benefits of scaling up multifactorial and multifaceted interventions to prevent CVD in patients with T2DM.

The proposed approach identifies verifiably useful phase-change solvents that exhibit favourable performance trade-offs compared to a reference CO2 capture solvent. The on-line use in CAMD of sustainability criteria favours the design of hydroxyl-containing solvents. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wood is recognised by the European Union as a promising and sustainable raw material. However, as with other materials, emissions and impacts must be monitored throughout the life cycle of products in order to maintain the positive environmental characteristics. Often a full LCA is carried out to assess the environmental footprint of a product, but some CAD programmes have integrated sustainability assessment as one of the functions. They allow for a simple emissions assessment during the modelling phase. The benefits are mainly recognised for environmentally conscious manufacturing, but some software makes it possible to determine the entire life cycle of a product. Considering the environmental impact in the product modelling phase with CAD software is a simpler solution for more conscious production. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether software that is primarily intended for mechanical modelling can also evaluate wood products and in what extent. Ensuring that the data gaps relating to the life cycle emissions of wood-based materials and products are closed will make it easier for CAD developers to include the assessment of wood in their LCA-like tools. Furthermore, as woodbased materials are very diverse, the integration of AI into such tools will enable faster and more accurate assessments.

AB Toxicity characterization of chemical emissions in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a complex task which usually proceeds via multimedia (fate, exposure and effect) models attached to models of dose-response relationships to assess the effects on target. Different models and approaches do exist, but all require a vast amount of data on the properties of the chemical compounds being assessed, which are hard to collect or hardly publicly available (especially for thousands of less common or newly developed chemicals), therefore hampering in practice the assessment in LCA. An example is USEtox, a consensual model for the characterization of human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity. This paper places itself in a line of research aiming at providing a methodology to reduce the number of input parameters necessary to run multimedia fate models, focusing in particular to the application of the USEtox toxicity model. By focusing on USEtox, in this paper two main goals are pursued: 1) performing an extensive exploratory analysis (using dimensionality reduction techniques) of the input space constituted by the substance-specific properties at the aim of detecting particular patterns in the data manifold and estimating the dimension of the subspace in which the data manifold actually lies; and 2) exploring the application of a set of linear models, based on partial least squares (PLS) regression, as well as a nonlinear model (general regression neural network - GRNN) in the seek for an automatic selection strategy of the most informative variables according to the modelled output (USEtox factor). After extensive analysis, the intrinsic dimension of the input manifold has been identified between three and four. The variables selected as most informative may vary according to the output modelled and the model used, but for the toxicity factors modelled in this paper the input variables selected as most informative are coherent with prior expectations based on scientific knowledge of toxicity factors modelling. Thus the outcomes of the analysis are promising for the future application of the approach to other portions of the model, affected by important data gaps, e.g., to the calculation of human health effect factors.

AB Accurate estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) is essential for crop growth simulations and agricultural management. This study conducted a field experiment with rice and measured the LAI in different rice growth periods. The multispectral bands (B) including red edge (RE, 730 nm +/- 16 nm), near-infrared (NIR, 840 nm +/- 26 nm), green (560 nm +/- 16 nm), red (650 nm +/- 16 nm), blue (450 nm +/- 16 nm), and visible light (RGB) were also obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with multispectral sensors (DJI-P4M, SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd.). Based on the bands, five vegetation indexes (VI) including Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Leaf Chlorophyll Index (LCI), Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Optimization Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) were calculated. The semi-empirical model (SEM), the random forest model (RF), and the Extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost) were used to estimate rice LAI based on multispectral bands, VIs, and their combinations, respectively. The results indicated that the GNDVI had the highest accuracy in the SEM (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.77). For the single band, NIR had the highest accuracy in both RF (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.98) and XGBoost (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.88). Band combination of NIR + red improved the estimation accuracy in both RF (R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.65) and XGBoost (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.63). NDRE and LCI were the first two single VIs for LAI estimation using both RF and XGBoost. However, putting more than one VI together could only increase the LAI estimation accuracy slightly. Meanwhile, the bands + VIs combinations could improve the accuracy in both RF and XGBoost. Our study recommended estimating rice LAI by a combination of red + NIR + OSAVI + NDVI + GNDVI + LCI + NDRE (2B + 5V) with XGBoost to obtain high accuracy and overcome the potential over-fitting issue (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.54).

AB Purpose: The association between traditional lipid parameters and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been extensively discussed. This study aims to evaluate and compare the lipoprotein combine index (LCI) and traditional lipid parameters [total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)] to identify NAFLD.<br /> Patients and Methods: The analysis included 14,251 participants from the NAfld in the Gifu Area, Longitudinal Analysis (NAGALA). Logistic regression models were employed to calculate standardized odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for assessing and comparing the association of LCI and traditional lipid parameters with NAFLD. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) for LCI and traditional lipid parameters in identifying NAFLD.<br /> Results: After adjusting for various confounders, we found that LCI was positively associated with NAFLD (OR=2.25, 95% CI 1.92- 2.63), and this association was stronger than that of traditional lipid parameters [OR: TC1.23, TG1.73 LDL-C1.10]. Further subgroup analyses revealed that the association of LCI with NAFLD was stronger than other traditional lipid parameters in all subgroups, including men and women, overweight/obese [body mass index (BMI)>= 25 kg/m(2)] and non-obese (BMI< 25 kg/m(2)), and older (age >= 45 years) and younger (age< 45 years) participants. Additionally, ROC analysis indicated that LCI (AUC=0.8118) had significantly higher accuracy (All DeLong P< 0.05) in identifying NAFLD compared to traditional lipid parameters (AUC: TC0.6309; TG0.7969; LDL-C0.6941); HDL-C0.7587). Sensitivity analysis further confirmed the robustness of the study findings.<br /> Conclusion: This study revealed for the first time a positive correlation between LCI and NAFLD. Compared to traditional lipid parameters, LCI has a higher correlation with NAFLD. Additionally, further ROC analysis demonstrated that LCI had higher accuracy in identifying NAFLD compared to traditional lipid parameters, suggesting that LCI may be a better marker for NAFLD identification than traditional lipid parameters.

AB PurposeLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an essential tool for evaluating the environmental impacts of products and processes, yet its integration with Machine Learning (ML) remains underexplored. This paper addresses the critical gap in the literature by analyzing how AI-enabled tools are incorporated into LCA methodology to predict potential environmental impacts. Our research aims to provide clear guidance on selecting the most appropriate ML methods tailored to the unique goals and specificities of LCA studies.MethodsThe research methodology involves a comprehensive literature review using targeted search strings to identify relevant studies. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to understand the publication trends. The identified studies were screened and categorized based on ML methods and their applications in LCA. A detailed content analysis was performed to evaluate the integration of ML in different phases of LCA, focusing on regression, classification, clustering, and other tasks. The findings were compiled into a synthesis table to highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of various ML models.Results and discussionThe analysis revealed that Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forest (RF) are the most frequently used ML models in LCA integration, primarily for regression and classification tasks. The study also found a significant gap in real-time dynamic LCA models, with existing models largely static. The synthesis table provides a comparative overview of ML models, indicating their effectiveness, sensitivity, and computational efficiency. ANN emerged as the most effective model, while Bayesian networks showed potential for further exploration due to their specific characteristics.ConclusionsIntegrating ML with LCA enhances the accuracy and efficiency of environmental impact predictions. However, the current use of ML in LCA is limited by data quality and the static nature of traditional LCA models. Future research should focus on developing dynamic LCA models and improving data quality to leverage the full potential of ML. Recommendations include exploring underutilized ML models and extending AI-enabled LCA applications to various sectors, including social contexts and the tertiary sector.

AB In this paper, a metamodel-based approach involving simulation data collection and data-driven techniques was used to forecast and optimize heating and cooling loads in three different climates in Morocco. The metamodel method is gaining popularity as it offers a better balance between accuracy and calculation time. In addition, a wrapper method was used as a feature selection approach to find the best feature subsets in order to reduce models' complexity. Therefore, the performances of eleven state-of-the-art algorithms including evolutionary-based algorithms, swarm intelligence-based algorithms and human-based algorithms, coupled with a learner such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support vector machine (SVM), were assessed. Hybrid model based on League championship algorithm (LCA), Discrete symbiotic organisms search (DSOS) algorithm, Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm showed better results in terms of accuracy and reduction of feature input parameters. Indeed, the best desired performances were obtained with LCA-SVM for cooling load, DSOS-SVM for heating load, PSO-ANN for both heating and cooling loads. On the other hand, to optimize the annual thermal load, the NSGA-II algorithm was used. Results showed a reduction of 68% of the total annual load compared to the base case in Meknes city, 73% in Ifrane and 67% in Marrakech. The solution that reflects a compromise between the two objective functions (i.e., cooling load and heating load) gives better results in terms of CO2 emissions reduction in all climates evaluated, except in the cold climate.

AB The availability and accuracy of data play a critical role in the development of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) models, as they directly impact the effectiveness and reliability of the model. Machine learning (ML) approach has the potential to improve the data quality, leading to enhanced performance of LCA models. In this study, ML algorithms (random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural network) were applied to predict the ethanol yield and NaOH consumption, which were key life cycle inventories for lignocellulosic bioethanol process. The prediction models exhibited a decent level of accuracy for ethanol yield (accuracy similar to 0.85) and NaOH consumption (accuracy > 0.8). In addition, ML algorithms (genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and simulate annealing) were applied to identify optimal feedstock characteristics and conditions for maximum ethanol yield. The optimization models showed an 18% improvement compared to the highest yield from the dataset (0.41 g/g). The ML models (prediction and optimization algorithms) were further integrated with the LCA model (GREET1) to enhance the ethanol yield and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission for target feedstocks. This resulted in a 6% and 19% improvement in ethanol yield and an approximately 8% and 14% reduction of GHG emissions for grass and corn stover, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing ML to predict LCA metrics for the development of LCA models and to optimize the process parameters to minimize environmental impact.

AB Lacking unit process data is a major challenge for developing life cycle inventory (LCI) in life cycle assessment (LCA). Previously, we developed a similarity-based approach to estimate missing unit process data, which works only when less than 5% of the data are missing in a unit process. In this study, we developed a more flexible machine learning model to estimate missing unit process data as a complement to our previous method. In particular, we adopted a decision tree-based supervised learning approach to use an existing unit process dataset (ecoinvent 3.1) to characterize the relationship between the known information (predictors) and the missing one (response). The results show that our model can successfully classify the zero and nonzero flows with a very low misclassification rate (0.79% when 10% of the data are missing). For nonzero flows, the model can accurately estimate their values with an R-2 over 0.7 when less than 20% of data are missing in one unit process. Our method can provide important data to complement primary LCI data for LCA studies and demonstrates the promising applications of machine learning techniques in LCA.

TI Mining Available Data from the United States Environmental Protection

DT Article
AB Demands for quick and accurate life cycle assessments create a need for methods to rapidly generate reliable life cycle inventories (LCI). Data mining is a suitable tool for this purpose, especially given the large amount of available governmental data. These data are typically applied to LCIs on a case by-case basis. As linked open data becomes more prevalent, it may be possible to automate LCI using data mining by establishing a reproducible approach for identifying, extracting, and processing the data. This work proposes a method for standardizing and eventually automating the discovery and use of publicly available data at the United States Environmental Protection Agency for chemical-manufacturing LCI. The method is developed using a case study of acetic acid. The data quality and gap analyses for the generated inventory found that the selected data sources can provide information with equal or better reliability and representativeness on air, water, hazardous waste, on-site energy usage, and production volumes but with key data gaps including material inputs, water usage, purchased electricity, and transportation requirements. A comparison of the generated LCI with existing data revealed that the data mining inventory is in reasonable agreement with existing data and may provide a more comprehensive inventory of air emissions and water discharges. The case study highlighted challenges for current data management practices that must be overcome to successfully automate the method using semantic technology. Benefits of the method are that the openly available data can be compiled in a standardized and transparent approach that supports potential automation with flexibility to incorporate new data sources as needed.

AB Purpose Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the process of systematically assessing impacts when there is an interaction between the environment and human activity. Machine learning (ML) with LCA methods can help contribute greatly to reducing impacts. The sheer number of input parameters and their uncertainties that contribute to the full life cycle make a broader application of ML complex and difficult to achieve. Hence a systems engineering approach should be taken to apply ML in isolation to aspects of the LCA. This study addresses the challenge of leveraging ML methods to deliver LCA solutions. The overarching hypothesis is that: LCA underpinned by ML methods and informed by dynamic data paves the way to more accurate LCA while supporting life cycle decision making. Methods In this study, previous research on ML for LCA were considered, and a literature review was undertaken. Results The results showed that ML can be a useful tool in certain aspects of the LCA. ML methods were shown to be applied efficiently in optimization scenarios in LCA. Finally, ML methods were integrated as part of existing inventory databases to streamline the LCA across many use cases. Conclusions The conclusions of this article summarise the characteristics of existing literature and provide suggestions for future work in limitations and gaps which were found in the literature.

AB Within a life cycle assessment (LCA), normalization is an essential part for interpretation. In Europe, only the European Union normalization factors (EU NFs), with 2000 as the reference year, are available for LCA practitioners, although they work on a regional level. The hypothesis of this research was based on the assumption that some regional NFs deviate from the EU NFs due to unique regional profiles, or because of previously omitted or generalized human impact. In this particular case study set in Slovenia has been tested. By working on the ReCiPe 1.08 life cycle impact assessment methodology, 18 impact categories were investigated, and an additional 3 were added: electromagnetic radiation, light pollution and electric use. To meet practitioners' needs, the most up-to-date inventory data was used with the reference years of 2007-2012. Out of 440 environmental interventions that were investigated, 139 had no characterization factors (CFs), 97 were estimated using machine learning and 42 had to be omitted. The final result confirmed our hypothesis. Twenty NFs were compared with the EU NFs, and the results have shown that on average, the NFs differ by a factor of 9.76 (median = 1.65). The reasons for the high deviation are due to natural land transformation, and ionising radiation, toxicological and ecotoxicological impact categories; where there are major data gaps in the CFs. The primary concern of the research was data availability for toxicological and ecotoxicological parameters for toxicity-related emissions, and the fact that original CFs covered only 50.25% of plant protection products used in Slovenia. Toxicological and ecotoxicological uncertainties were illustrated by comparing four different results. Future studies should be focused on the use of machine learning to provide the next generation of CFs and to go beyond the CFs' damage-oriented assessment. Remediation should be the new endpoint category and its units should be joules. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Exploration methods combine parametric energy assessments and data visualization to support building designers at early design stages. When exploration methods come to Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Global Warming Potential (GWP) assessment, a larger number of input parameters induces a very high computation load. Previous researches suggested using Sensitivity Analysis (SA) to decrease the space exploration thanks to their sampling techniques, and input sensitivities. However, this theoretical framework has almost never been applied to building LCA so far and underline two major issues. Upon SA techniques, which one is most suitable for LCA input specificities? How is it possible to extend the exploration process outside the limits of SA samples? This article addressed these questions thanks to an extensive state-of-the-art, the description of a new method combining Sobol SA and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and a case study. The Sobol method delivered satisfying results with the computation of quantitative indices. Then, an Artificial Neural Network trained on the data generated by the SA was used to predict the GWP of new design alternatives in a small amount of time, and with a coefficient of determination higher than 0.9. Finally, the proposed method adapted exploration methods to the LCA complexity.

AB As the economy has improved in Iran, residents have produced more municipal solid wastes in recent decades. The various scenarios for municipal solid waste management are projected with the main purpose for reduction of environmental impact and energy production. The aim of this study is to evaluate the energy consumption and environmental impacts of incineration and landfill scenarios. The data used in this study are supplied by Waste Managemerit Organization of Tehran Municipality, Iran. Results of the energy analysis show that 406.08 GJ (8500 t MSW)(-1) of energy is consumed in the process of incineration and landfill with transportation system. Most energy consumption is related to transportation. Life cycle assessment indicates that incineration leads to the reduction of detrimental factors related to toxicity as the results of electricity generation and the production of phosphate fertilizers. Besides, the rates of daily greenhouse gas emissions from incineration and landfill are estimated at 4499.07 and 92,170.30 kg CO2 (eq.), respectively. In this study, feed-forward back-propagation models based on Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm are developed for predicting electricity and environmental factors against energy consumption for municipal solid waste management. An Artificial Neural Network model with 4-5-5-11 structure is selected as the best structure. Results show that, in the selected model, the amount of R-2 varies in the ranges of 0.948-0.999 for training, testing and validation, demonstrating excellent performance in predicting all outputs based on the input factors. Sensitivity analysis for Artificial Neural Network model indicates that transportation has the highest sensitivity in four impact categories including eutrophication, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, human toxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity.

AB A study was conducted in Shahrekord city, Iran, focusing on improving the production of almond and walnut crops on rural agricultural lands. The gardeners selected for the study shared similar characteristics and production histories. One of the major challenges in producing these crops was the manual harvesting process, which required a significant amount of human labor in the region. To collect data, questionnaires and face-to-face interviews were conducted. The study used machine learning models, specifically artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models, to predict energy use efficiency and environmental impacts in almond and walnut production. Among the models used, the ANFIS model with a three-level topology was found to be the most accurate in predicting output energy generation and environmental impacts in both almond and walnut production. The R2 values for the testing stage ranged from 0.969 to 0.996 for output energy generation and 0.994 to 0.997 for environmental impacts. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of using machine learning models like ANN and ANFIS in predicting energy use efficiency and environmental impacts in almond and walnut production, which can aid in planning and managing these crops more sustainably and efficiently in the future.

AB Conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) that relies on static coefficients is usually based on yearly averages. However, the impacts of electricity supply vary remarkably on an hourly basis. Thus, a company production plan is reassessed to reduce selected LCA impacts due to electricity consumption. To achieve this, the company will need a forecast of hourly LCA impacts due to electricity consumption, which can be directly forecast with the Direct Forecasting (DF) approach. Alternatively, the Electricity Technological Mix Forecasting (ETMF) forecasts the electricity production of the technologies in the mix and subsequently linearly combines it with unitary LCA impact indicators. Here, we assessed different machine learning models to forecast two LCA impact indicators for the consumption of electricity in the Italy-North control zone. The feed-forward neural network (NN) with the ETMF approach was the best perfomer among the assessed forecasting models. In our dataset, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) performed worse than feed-forward neural networks. Due to its better forecasting performance, the ETMF approach was preferred over the DF approach. This was due to its flexibility and scalability with easy updates or expansion of the selected forecast indicators, and due to its ability to assess technology-specific errors in the forecasting. Finally, we propose to adopt the correlation of LCA impact indicators within the dataset to select indicators while avoiding unconscious burden-shifting.

DE predictive life cycle assessment; artificial neural network; early
   process development stage; comparison of pathway alternatives
AB Growing environmental concern and strict regulations led to an increasing effort of the chemical industry to develop greener production pathways. To ensure that this development indeed improves environmental aspects requires an early-stage estimation of the environmental impact in early process design. An accepted method to evaluate the environmental impact is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). However, LCA requires detailed data on mass and energy balances, which is usually limited in early process design. Therefore, predictive LCA approaches are required. Current predictive LCA approaches estimate the environmental impacts of chemicals only based on molecular descriptors. Thus, the predicted impacts are independent from the chosen production process. A potentially greener process cannot be distinguished from the conventional route. In this work, we propose a fully predictive, neural network-based framework, which utilizes both molecular and process descriptors to distinguish between production pathways. The framework is fully automatized and includes feature selection, setup of the network architecture, and predicts 17 environmental impact categories. The pathway-specific prediction is illustrated for two examples, comparing the CO2-based production of methanol and formic acid to their respective fossil production pathway. The presented framework is competitive to LCA predictions from literature but can now also distinguish between process alternatives. Thus, our framework can serve as initial screening tool to identify environmentally beneficial process alternatives.

AB Approximately 40% of the European energy consumption and a large proportion of environmental impacts are related to the building sector. However, the selection of adequate and correct designs can provide considerable energy savings and reduce environmental impacts. To achieve this objective, a simultaneous energy and environmental assessment of a building's life cycle is necessary. To date, the resolution of this complex problem is entrusted to numerous software and calculation algorithms that are often complex to use. They involve long diagnosis phases and are characterised by the lack of a common language. Despite the efforts by the scientific community in the building sector, there is no simple and reliable tool that simultaneously solves the energy and environmental balance of buildings. In this work, the authors address this challenge by proposing the application of an Artificial Neural Network. Due to the high reliability of learning algorithms in the resolution of complex and non-linear problems, it was possible to simultaneously solve two different but strongly dependent aspects after a deep training phase. In previous researches, the authors applied several topologies of neural networks, which were trained on a large and representative database and developed for the Italian building stock. The database, characterised by several building models simulated in different climatic conditions, collects 29 inputs (13 energy data and 16 environmental data) and provides 7 outputs, 1 for heating energy demand and 6 of the most used indicators in life cycle assessment of buildings. A statistical analysis of the results confirmed that the proposed method is appropriate to achieve the goal of the study. The best artificial neural network for each output presented low Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error lower than 5%, and determination coefficient close to 1. The excellent results confirmed that this methodology can be extended in any context and to any condition (other countries and building stocks). Furthermore, the implementation of this solution algorithm in a software program can enable the development of a suitable decision support tool, which is simple, reliable, and easy to use even for a nonexpert user. The possibility to use an instrument to predict a building's performance in its design and planning phase, represent an important result to support decision-making processes toward more sustainable choices.

ID EMERGY ANALYSIS
AB From a global perspective, the ecological sustainability of building systems has always been a hot research topic, especially in China, where the annual amount of new construction is nearly half of the world. The difficulty is making a complete and accurate ecological assessment of the building system. This study has designed and adopted the LCA-Emergy-ANN framework to assess and analyze an airport building system for sustainability. The results demonstrate that building material emergy and operational stage emergy play a critical role and account for 92.4% of the entire emergy, which are the primary contributors. As the vital indicator, the emergy sustainability index (ESI) is 0.669, which is unsustainable (The eligibility standard is 1). Simultaneously, to ensure the accuracy of the data results, sensitivity analysis was performed. The artificial neural network (ANN) was used by integrating the LCA method and emergy approach to predict the sustainability trend in the long run. In the end, the optimization strategy is proposed to enhance the sustainability of the building system.

AB Post-tensioning has become a strong contender for manufacturing reinforced concrete (RC) members, especially for flat slabs in large-span structures. Post-tensioned (PT) slabs can lead to considerable material savings while reducing the embodied carbon (embodied CO2), construction time, and life cycle maintenance and repair costs. In this research, a novel hybrid Firefly-Artificial Neural Network (Firefly-ANN) computational intelligence model was developed to estimate the cost effectiveness and embodied CO2 of PT slabs with different design variables. To develop the dataset, several numerical models with various design variables, including the pattern of tendons, slab thickness, mechanical properties of materials, and span of slabs, were developed to investigate the sustainability and economic competitiveness of the derived designs compared to benchmark conventional RC flat slabs. Several performance measures, including punching shear and heel drop vibration induced by human activity, were used as design constraints to satisfy safety and serviceability criteria. The economic competitiveness of PT slabs was more evident in larger spans where the cost and embodied CO2 emissions decreased by 39% and 12%, respectively, in PT slabs with a 12-m span length compared to conventional RC slabs. Sensitivity analysis also confirmed that the cost and embodied CO2 emissions were very sensitive to the slab thickness by 86% and 62%, respectively.

AB Optimizing the energy flows of agricultural production is a concern in order to find the most appropriate mix of agricultural inputs, which would in turn minimize energy consumption and maximize energy output. Thus, the aim of this study is to model the energy flows of kiwifruit production in Guilan province of Iran (as a case study) using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) + Genetic Algorithm (GA) modeling and Multiple Linear Regressions (MLR) + GA modeling. The results indicated that the highest energy consumption were attributed to electricity and chemical fertilizers with the shares of 42% and 25%, respectively. Energy indices such as energy use efficiency, energy productivity, specific energy and net energy were determined to be 0.48, 0.25 kgMJ(-1), 4.01 MJkg(-1), and -54,644 MJha(-1). The performance indices such as coefficient of determination (R-2) and efficiency (EF) for the best MLR model were determined to be 0.61 and 0.60%, respectively. Moreover, the same indices for the best developed ANN model were 0.73 and 0.72%, respectively. Overall, it was concluded that the ANNs models could better predict the energy output than the MLRs models and the performance of ANN highlighted that this model may be applied to prognosticate the energy output of kiwifruit production. To conclude, a comparison between ANN + GA and MLR + GA clearly demonstrated the better performance of ANN + GA to optimize the energy flows of Iranian kiwifruit production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Philippines' Biofuels Act of 2006 has mandated a progressive increase of biofuel blend in the country's fuel mix. This has become one of the country's initiatives on reducing fossil fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission. This Act has led to the primary utilization of coconut oil far biodiesel production. In the recent years, the frequency of typhoons and insect infestation has led to decrease of biodiesel yield. A shift in the feedstock may help curb this issue, such in the case of algal biofuels. Its high oil yield per hectare and fast growth rate makes algal biofuels ideal for the typhoon-prone archipelagic country. Introducing this new technology to the country would entail detailed assessments on the technology's life cycle. In this regard, the life cycle assessment can be utilized to determine the environmental implications of producing algal-based biofuels in the Philippines. It provides the detailed effects of the life cycle to the different environmental impacts. As these different impacts are multidimensional in nature, weighting prioritization is generally applied as a tool for quantitatively comparing the different impacts. Weight prioritization can be assessed through different multitudes of methodologies where analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is one of the promising approaches. The AHP derives the weight prioritization by acquiring raw data from surveys of a group of stakeholders. A problem arise in the AHP methodology as there can exist inconsistencies and incomplete information from the surveys acquired. Through the use of pattern recognition of the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm, a probable methodology may be generated to address the inconsistency of the results of the AHP survey. In this paper, we propose the demonstration of the ANN algorithm in creating a model that will fit the data from the survey with the values of the weight prioritization. The study has showed, with 11 hidden nodes, a regression value of 0.96 can be achieved with the predicted weights of the ANN compared to the AHP. The study can be further improved by providing larger quantities of data to the ANN for better training, of which, statistical tools may be applied for generating such data The result of this study can aid in the development of a robust AHP-based decision system for inconsistent and incomplete data.

AB Considering the gaps in the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) modelling, this article aims to: i) present models that combine AI and environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), ii) analyse the role of AI in photovoltaics, smart grids and small-island economies. The methodology used is based upon selection of publications and analysis. Regarding LCA/AI models, the results show that AI can anticipate environmental impacts but model performance depends on the amount of data available. LCA/AI models can be used for eco-design and decisionmaking. However, it is necessary to develop standardised methodologies to evaluate AI environmental impacts. Regarding AI and photovoltaics, AI provides remarkably interesting applications: design, optimisation and prediction of parameters related to different kinds of photovoltaics (concentrating, building-integrated, etc.). As for AI and smart grids, AI offers advantages such as integration of intermittent renewable energy sources and decentralised-grid management. With respect to AI and small-island economies, factors such as effective energy storage, energy plans and estimation of the degree of susceptibility to disasters are important. Generally speaking, and considering the above-mentioned issues, it can be argued that AI poses multiple challenges: machine-learning models on a large-scale basis; the internet of things; options to reduce negative environmental impacts and so on.

AB Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been the focus of several studies when it comes to evaluating the pile's bearing capacity. Nonetheless, the principal drawbacks of employing this method are the sluggish rate of convergence and the constraints of ANN in locating global minima. The current work aimed to build four ANN -based prediction models enhanced with methods from the black hole algorithm (BHA), league championship algorithm (LCA), shuffled complex evolution (SCE), and symbiotic organisms search (SOS) to estimate the carrying capacity of piles in cold climates. To provide the crucial dataset required to build the model, fifty-eight concrete pile experiments were conducted. The pile geometrical properties, internal friction angle phi shaft, internal friction angle phi tip, pile length, pile area, and vertical effective stress were established as the network inputs, and the BHA, LCA, SCE, and SOS -based ANN models were set up to provide the pile bearing capacity as the output. Following a sensitivity analysis to determine the optimal BHA, LCA, SCE, and SOS parameters and a train and test procedure to determine the optimal network architecture or the number of hidden nodes, the best prediction approach was selected. The outcomes show a good agreement between the measured bearing capabilities and the pile bearing capacities forecasted by SCE-MLP. The testing dataset's respective mean square error and coefficient of determination, which are 0.91846 and 391.1539, indicate that using the SCE-MLP approach as a practical, efficient, and highly reliable technique to forecast the pile's bearing capacity is advantageous.

AB This study was conducted to analyze and model the energy consumption and environmental indicators for different wheat production systems in Qazvin province. Information needed for this study, related to 2021-2022, data was collected by monitoring machinery, and inputs during wheat production were interviewed by farmers and filled out questionnaires. The purpose of this study includes: (1) estimating the fuel consumption and energy of inputs in different wheat production systems, (2) estimating the environmental impact associated with input consumption using life cycle assessment (LCA), and (3) providing suggestions for optimization. The results showed wheat production in irrigated conservation tillage system has energy ratio (2.12) and energy produc-tivity (0.18 kg MJ-1) suitable compared to conventional irrigated and rainfed tillage, and conservation rainfed tillage. Nitrogen fertilizer (55%-68%) and fuel consumption (15%-31%) of affect the energy consumption of four wheat cultivation systems. Three categories of damage to human health, ecosystem and resources in LCA were using the ReCiPe2016 method. Resource damage category for conventional tillage irrigation (76.05 USD2013) has significant pollution. The share of seed emissions, On-Farm emissions and nitrogen emissions affect the categories of damage to human health, ecosystems and resources, respectively. The results of the Cobb -Douglas model showed that T3 (fertilization and weed control) was significant at the level of 1% among other inputs. T1 (chisel packer roller), T2 (planting) and T4 (harvest and straw packaging) were significant at 5% level. The results of artificial neural network (ANN) of conventional rainfed cultivation showed that 6 input layers, 7 hidden layers with 10 hidden neurons and 1 output parameter were selected as the best structure. R2 and RMSE for fuel consumption were 0.95 and 43.65, respectively. As a result, the ANN results show higher accuracy than the Cobb-Douglas model.

AB This study outlines the applicability of four metaheuristic algorithms, namely, whale optimization algorithm (WOA), league champion optimization (LCA), moth flame optimization (MFO), and ant colony optimization (ACO), for performance improvement of an artificial neural network (ANN) in analyzing the bearing capacity of footings settled on two-layered soils. To this end, the models estimate the stability/failure of the system by taking into consideration soil key factors. The complexity of each network is optimized through a sensitivity analysis process. The performance of the ensembles is compared with a typical ANN to evaluate the efficiency of the applied optimizers. It was shown that the incorporation of the WOA, LCA, MFO, and ACO algorithms resulted in 14.49%, 13.41%, 18.30%, and 35.75% reductions in the prediction error of the ANN, respectively. Moreover, a ranking system is developed to compare the efficiency of the used models. The results revealed that the ACO ANN performs most accurately, followed by the MFO ANN, WOA ANN, and LCA ANN. Lastly, the outcomes demonstrated that the ACO ANN can be a promising alternative to traditional methods used for analyzing the bearing capacity of two-layered soils.

AB A comprehensive review of optimization research concerning the design and proportioning of concrete mixtures is presented herein. Mixture design optimization is motivated by an ever-increasing need for designers and decision-makers to proportion concrete mixtures that satisfy multiple - oftentimes competing - performance requirements, including cost, workability, mechanical properties, durability, and environmental sustainability. In this review, we first discuss common mathematical problem formulations, decisions, objectives, and constraints pertaining to concrete mixture design optimization. Subsequently, we examine the types of models employed to approximate properties of concrete, which include a variety of linear combination, statistical, machine learning, and physics-based models that are required to optimize the proportions of a mixture. We then review and discuss computational methods used to optimize concrete mixtures in the context of surveyed literature. Finally, we highlight and discuss current trends and opportunities for advancing the field of concrete mixture design optimization in context of the current state of the art.

AB Sustainable solvents are crucial for chemical processes and can be tailored to applications by Computer-Aided Molecular and Process Design (CAMPD). Recent CAMPD methods consider not only economics but also environmental hazards and impacts. However, holistic environmental assessment needs to address the complete life cycle of solvents. Here, we propose a CAMPD framework integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of solvents from cradle-to-grave: COSMO-susCAMPD. The framework builds on the COSMO-CAMPD method for predictive design of solvents using COSMO-RS and pinch-based process models. Cradle-to-grave LCA is enabled by combining predictive LCA from cradle-to-gate using an artificial neural network with gate-to-grave life cycle inventory data from the process models. The framework is applied to design solvents in a hybrid extraction-distillation process. The results highlight the need for cradle-to-grave LCA as objective function: Heuristics, economics, or cradle-to-gate LCA lead to suboptimal solvent choices. COSMO-susCAMPD thus enables the holistic environmental design of solvents using cradle-to-grave LCA. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Uncertainty about the energy use efficiency, lack of knowledge about economic outcomes, and its environmental consequences have always take risks in changing cultivation patterns and moving towards the optimal path. Accordingly, this study provided mathematical, artificial neural networks (ANNs), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods to predict output energy, economic profit, and global warming potential (GWP) of wheat production. For this purpose, 75 wheat farms located in the central area of Hamadan province, Iran, were selected randomly, and data were gathered through oral interviews. After collecting input and output energies data, the averages of inputs and outputs energies were obtained about 43055 MJ ha(-1) and 117407 MJ ha(-1), respectively. Economic analysis has performed in the next step. Its results revealed that the benefit-to-cost ratio and net return were computed about 2.33 and 488.29 $ per ha for wheat production. Then, life cycle assessment (LCA) was utilized to specify the environmental effects of wheat cultivation, and its results demonstrated that GWP is the most important environmental impact which caused 624.29 kg CO2eq. during 1 ton of wheat production. Modeling results illustrated R-2 was varied between 0.264 and 0.978 in the linear regression, 0.313 and 954 in the best structure of ANN with two hidden layers, and 0.520 and 0.962 in the ANFIS with three-level structure. Modeling comparison indicated that generally, ANFIS model with considering all uncertainty items can be offered better prediction models among all and after that ANN with considering non-linear parameters is in the next rank.

AB Featured Application Potential applications of the research concerns AI-supported eco-design and eco-production. In the present study, the authors analyze, supported by the use of artificial intelligence, the environmental solutions implemented in selected manufacturing companies using the example of the Great Poland Voivodship. The companies analyzed were selected from different industry sectors and were of different sizes, divided into two groups: small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large enterprises (LEs). The authors observed the environmental activities of these two groups of companies, paying particular attention to the differences that were evident. The study is based on a questionnaire survey. All survey questions referred to the life cycle of a product, ranging from design, production, and use to recycling processes. We discuss the environmental solutions proposed by enterprises of different sizes and at different stages of the product's life cycle. The goal of this study is three-fold: (1) To investigate the differences in the introduction of environmental issues in SMEs and LEs in the Greater Poland Voivodship, Poland; (2) to examine whether companies in this Voivodship are equally aware of the impact of their business activities and their products on the environment; and (3) to discover novel, more rapid, and simpler methods to analyze the environmental sustainability of companies, including efficient models based on artificial intelligence. An analysis based on ANNs (artificial neural networks) was performed. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the use of a combination of research data and methods using artificial intelligent tools to develop and scalable conclusions. This approach is unique and has no equivalent in the literature. An analysis was conducted via two perspectives: (1) The level of environmental solutions implemented at successive stages of the product's life cycle and (2) the size of the company. The results show significant differences between the environmental practices of small, medium, and large Polish enterprises, and reveal the emerging trends in enterprise operations, which will be subject to an AI-based analysis.

AB Whole-life carbon emissions (WLCE) studies are critical in assessing the environmental impact of buildings and promoting sustainable design practices. However, existing methods for estimating WLCE are time-consuming and data-intensive, limiting their usefulness in the early building design stages. In response to this, this research introduces a novel approach by harnessing various machine learning algorithms to predict WLCE and WLCE intensity (normalised by floor area) for buildings. To evaluate the suitability of machine learning algorithms, we conducted an experiment involving ten algorithms to build the prediction models. These models were trained using data from 150 typical residential properties in Cornwall, UK, along with 28 features obtained from a comprehensive survey, including floor area, heating type, and occupant characteristics. The ten algorithms include Multiple Linear Regression, and non-linear algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest. Performance evaluation metrics, such as coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), means squared error (MSE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and elapsed time, were employed. Our research contributes to the field by showcasing the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting building WLCE. We reveal that all the tested machine learning algorithms have the capability to predict WLCE and WLCE intensity, non-linear models outperform linear ones, and the Random Forest (RF) model demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy, stability, and efficiency. This research encourages the integration of life cycle studies into the early design stage, even within tight building design schedules, offering practical guidance to architects and designers. Furthermore, these results also benefit a wide range of stakeholders, not only the architects but also the engineers, policymakers, and life cycle assessment (LCA) researchers, contributing to the advancement of data-driven sustainability approaches within the building sector.

AB Leaf-cutting ants are the main group of insect pests in Brazilian forest plantations, and their nests can be visually identified in remotely sensed images. This study compares two distinct pattern recognition methodologies, each with different computational costs, for detecting and measuring leaf-cutting ant (LCA) nests in RGB images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aiming to develop an efficient detection system for day-to-day Eucalyptus plantation management. The first methodology (MLP) is based on traditional Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks combined with the sliding window technique. The second methodology uses the new Convolutional Neural Networks YOLOv5 architecture, which is a deep learning approach applied to RGB imagery and requires more time and memory. For each input image, existing LCA nests were detected and measured based on their bounding box areas. Images were classified to detect the presence and measure the area of LCA nests. The quality of both methodologies were evaluated using accuracy, Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) metrics, considering training and test data sets. Performances of the YOLOv5 methodology were highly superior to those of the MLP methodology, with 98.45% accuracy using the YOLOv5 large architecture net and 0.49% MAPE in measuring the nests with YOLOv5s nets, whose performance was superior to the MLP results (65.45%), demonstrating high complexity in identifying the targets in the field. The YOLOv5 approach, applied to RGB images acquired by UAVs, shows great promise for precision monitoring of LCA nests, and thus can reduce and optimize insecticide use in forest plantation areas.

AB Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a foundational method for quantitative assessment of sustainability. Increasing data availability and rapid development of machine learning (ML) approaches offer new opportunities to advance LCA. Here, we review current progress and knowledge gaps in applying ML techniques to support LCA, and identify future research directions for LCAs to better harness the power of ML. This review analyzes forty studies reporting quantitative assessment with a combination of LCA and ML methods. We found that ML approaches have been used for generating life cycle inventories, computing characterization factors, estimating life cycle impacts, and supporting life cycle interpretation. Most of the reviewed studies employed a single ML method, with artificial neural networks (ANNs) as the most frequently applied approach. Both supervised and unsupervised ML techniques were used in LCA studies. For studies using supervised ML, training datasets were derived from diverse sources, such as literature, lab experiments, existing databases, and model simulations. Over 70 % of these reviewed studies trained ML models with less than 1500 sample datasets. Although these reviewed studies showed that ML approaches help improve prediction accuracy, pattern discovery and computational efficiency, multiple areas deserve further research. First, continuous data collection and compilation is needed to support more reliable ML and LCA modeling. Second, future studies should report sufficient details regarding the selection criteria for ML models and present model uncertainty analysis. Third, incorporating deep learning models into LCA holds promise to further improve life cycle inventory and impact assessment. Finally, the complexity of current environmental challenges calls for interdisciplinary collaborative research to achieve deep integration of ML into LCA to support sustainable development.

AB Integrated watershed modeling is needed to couple water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) with agricultural management for holistic watershed nutrient management. Surrogate modeling can facilitate model coupling. This study applies artificial neural networks (ANNs) as surrogate models for WRRF models to efficiently evaluate the long-term treatment performance and cost under influent fluctuations. Specifically, we first developed five WRRFs, including activated sludge, activated sludge with chemical precipitation (ASCP), enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), EBPR with acetate addition (EBPR-A), and EBPR with struvite recovery (EBPR-S), in a high-fidelity simulation program (GPS-X). The five WRRFs were based on an existing plant that treats combined domestic and industrial wastewater. The ANNs have satisfactory performance in capturing nonlinear biological behaviors for all five WRRFs, even though the prediction performance (R-square) slightly decreases as the model complexity increases. We advanced ANNs application in WRRF models by simulating long-term (10-yr) performance with monthly influent fluctuations using ANNs trained by simulation data from steady-state models and evaluated their performance on Phosphorus (P) and Nitrogen (N) removal. EBPR-S shows the most resilience, while EBPR is more sensitive to influent characteristics impacted by stormwater inflow. When comparing life cycle costs of N and P removal for each layout over the 10-yr simulation period, EPBR-S is the most cost-effective alternative, highlighting both the operational and cost benefits of side-stream P recovery. By capturing both nonlinear behaviors of biological treatment and operating costs with computationally lean ANNs, this study provides a paradigm for integrating complex WRRF models within integrated watershed modeling frameworks.

AB This study aims to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the impact of urbanisation on the urban ecosystem in the city of Abha, Saudi Arabia, by analysing land use changes, urbanisation processes and their ecological impacts. Using a multidisciplinary approach, a novel remote sensingbased urban ecological condition index (RSUSEI) will be developed and applied to assess the ecological status of urban surfaces. Therefore, the identification and quantification of urbanisation is important. To do so, we used hyper-tuned artificial neural network (ANN) as well as Land Cover Change Rate (LCCR), Land Cover Index (LCI) and Landscape Expansion Index (LEI). For the development of (RSUSEI), we have used four advanced models such as fuzzy Logic, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to integrate various ecological parameters. In order to obtain more information for better decision making in urban planning, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses based on a deep neural network (DNN) were also used. The results of the study show a multi-layered pattern of urbanisation in Saudi Arabian cities reflected in the LCCR, indicating rapid urban expansion, especially in the built-up areas with an LCCR of 0.112 over the 30-year period, corresponding to a more than four-fold increase in urban land cover. At the same time, the LCI shows a remarkable increase in 'built-up' areas from 3.217% to 13.982%, reflecting the substantial conversion of other land cover types to urban uses. Furthermore, the LEI emphasises the complexity of urban growth. Outward expansion (118.98 km2), Edge-Expansion (95.22 km2) and Infilling (5.00 km2) together paint a picture of a city expanding outwards while filling gaps in the existing urban fabric. The RSUSEI model shows that the zone of extremely poor ecological condition covers an area of 157-250 km2, while the natural zone covers 91-410 km2. The DNN based sensitivity analysis is useful to determine the optimal model, while the integrated models have lower input parameter uncertainty than other models. The results of the study have significant implications for the management of urban ecosystems in arid areas and the protection of natural habitats while improving the quality of life of urban residents. The RSUSEI model can be used effectively to assess urban surface ecology and inform urban management techniques.

AB This study introduces an integrated system based on geothermal and solar energy to provide useful products such as electricity, freshwater, and hydrogen. In the proposed system, a solar unit including parabolic trough collectors has been used to improve the performance of the system and increase the mentioned products. The lowtemperature geothermal stream returns to the ground after passing through a thermoelectric generator unit. A combination of Rankine and organic Rankine cycles is used to supply electricity and run the water electrolysis unit. This study aims to address the inefficient heat recovery in a combined solar and geothermal resource system by utilizing waste heat to generate clean hydrogen. A parametric study and sensitivity analysis are considered to investigate the effect of design parameters on the main outputs of the system. After evaluating the system from energy, exergy, and economic perspectives, a multi-objective optimization process with a combination of artificial neural network and genetic algorithm was performed on the system. The optimization problem is divided into two cases (scenarios). Each case considers energy efficiency and total cost rate as objective functions. In addition, hydrogen and freshwater production rates are considered as the third objective function in cases A and B, respectively. The optimization results showed that in case A, the optimal values of exergy efficiency, hydrogen production, and total cost rate are 15.54%, 6.18 kg/h, and 85.9 $/h, respectively. Also, in case B, values of 15.09%, 3527.79 kg/h, and 89.44 $/h are calculated for exergy efficiency, freshwater production, and total cost rate, respectively. A case study conducted in Tehran revealed that the peak production of various products is observed in May, which leads to the production of 623.14 kW of electricity, 5.35 kg/h of hydrogen, and 1948.9 kg/h of freshwater in the base condition.

AB In the commercial freight industry, tire retreading decisions are often conservative due to limited knowledge of a tire's remaining service life. This practice leads to increased costs and material waste. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for estimating tire casing life and retreadability, focusing on usage data rather than wear information. This approach could extend the tire's lifespan and reduce landfill waste. Data integration from diverse tire casing measurement sources presents challenges, including imbalanced removal data. Our methodology addresses these challenges by using historical inspection, telematics, and finite element modeling (FEM) datasets. We introduce "Tire Casing Energy" as a comprehensive usage input and apply a Variance-Reduction Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (VR-SMOTE) for data imbalance rectification. A random forest model is used to estimate the state of the tire casing and the casing removal probability, with Bayesian optimization applied for hyperparameter tuning, enhancing model accuracy. The proposed prediction framework is able to differentiate different truck fleets and tire locations based on their usage parameters. With the aid of this machine learning model, the importance and sensitivity of different tire usage parameters can be obtained, which is beneficial to maximize tire life.

AB One of the most significant, intricate, and little-discussed aspects of pressurized irrigation is cost estimation. This study attempts to model the early-stage cost of the drip irrigation system using a database of 515 projects divided into four sections the cost of the pumping station and central control system (TCP), the cost of on-farm equipment (TCF), the cost of installation and operation on-farm and pumping station (TCI), and the total cost (TCT). First, 39 environmental and management features affecting the cost of the listed sectors were extracted for each of the 515 projects previously mentioned. A database (a matrix of 515 x 43) was created, and the costs of all projects were updated for the baseline year of 2022. Then, several feature selection algorithms, such as WCC, LCA, GA, PSO, ACO, ICA, LA, HTS, FOA, DSOS, and CUK, were employed to choose the most significant features that had the biggest influence on the system cost. The selection of features was carried out for all features (a total of 39 features) as well as for easily available features (those features that existed before the irrigation system's design phase, 18 features). Then, different machine learning models such as Multivariate Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Gene Expression Programming, Genetic Algorithms, Deep Learning, and Decision Trees, were used to estimate the costs of each of the of the aforementioned sections. Support vector machine (SVM) and optimization algorithms (Wrapper) were found to be the best learner and feature selection techniques, respectively, out of all the available feature selection algorithms. The two LCA and FOA algorithms produced the best estimation, according to the evaluation criteria results. Their RMSE for all features was 0.0020 and 0.0018, respectively, and their R2 was 0.94 and 0.94. For readily available features, these criteria were 0.0006 and 0.95 for both algorithms. In the part of the overall feature, the early-stage cost modeling with selected features revealed that the SVM model (with RBF Kernel) is the best model among the four cost sections discussed. Its evaluation criteria in the training stage are R2 = 0.923, RMSE = 0.008, and VE = 0.082; in the testing stage, they are R2 = 0.893, RMSE = 0.009, and VE = 0.102. The ANN model (MLP) was found to be the best model for a subset of features in the easily available feature part, with R2 = 0.912, RMSE = 0.008, and VE = 0.083 in the training stage and R2 = 0.882, RMSE = 0.009, and VE = 0.103 in the testing stage. The findings of this study can be utilized to highly accurately estimate the cost of local irrigation systems based on the recognized environmental and management parameters and by employing particular models.

AB The present study revealed the optimum co-pyrolysis process condition and simultaneously evaluated the environmental impact potential during co-valorisation of electronic plastic waste (WEEP) with Hydnocarpus de-oiled seed cake (HDSC) to produce renewable hydrocarbon fuel. In this work, the primary co-pyrolysis process parameters such as operating temperature, mixture ratio, and catalyst loading were modeled and optimized using a combined approach of both Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In the optimized condition, a maximum pyrolysis oil yield of 30.79 wt% was achieved at an operating temperature of 530 degrees C, a mixture ratio of 0.49, and catalyst loading of 20 wt%. The obtained co-pyrolysis products were characterized to evaluate their physiochemical properties. Finally, a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) of the scaled-up microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis plant has been modeled, and the result revealed that the emission levels of 771.95 kg CO2 eq, 3.11 kg SO2 eq, 1.69 kg PO4 eq, 338.59 DCB eq, and 0.11 kg C2H4 eq were projected for processing 1 tonne of feedstock. Further, sensitivity analysis revealed that a decrease of 15% in electricity consumption results in a reduction of the overall environmental impact by 13.69%. Above results demonstrate that microwave co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastic waste holds great potential for positive energy production and negative emission technology when compared to other waste management methods. Hence, this investi-gation paves the way for the sustainable conversion of e-waste plastic and biomass residue into renewable fuel and helps to achieve the sustainability goal of reducing GWP emissions.

AB Understanding the environmental implications of activated carbon (AC) produced from diverse biomass feedstocks is critical for biomass screening and process optimization for sustainability. Many studies have developed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for biomass-derived AC. However, most of them either focused on individual biomass species with differing process conditions or compared multiple biomass feedstocks without investigating the impacts of feedstocks and process variations. Developing LCA for AC from diverse biomass is time-consuming and challenging due to the lack of process data (e.g., energy and mass balance). This study addresses these knowledge gaps by developing a modeling framework that integrates artificial neural network (ANN), a machine learning approach, and kinetic-based process simulation. The integrated framework is able to generate Life Cycle Inventory data of AC produced from 73 different types of woody biomass with 250 characterization data samples. The results show large variations in energy consumption and GHG emissions across different biomass species (43.4-277 MJ/kg AC and 3.96-22.0 kg CO2-eq/kg AC). The sensitivity analysis indicates that biomass composition (e.g., hydrogen and oxygen content) and process operational conditions (e.g., activation temperature) have large impacts on energy consumption and GHG emissions associated with AC production.

AB Agriculture is one of the major energy consumers in food supply chain. In this regard, exergy analysis can be used as a decision support tool toward evaluation of the energy flow of the production system, identification of energy hotspots, and development of new energy management scenarios. This study applied a hybrid exergy analysis + artificial neural networks + genetic algorithm to optimize five tropical crop production systems i.e., banana, mango, jujube, guava, and sapodilla. Cumulative Degree of Perfection and Renewability Index were used for evaluating the exergy flows of the fruit production systems. The results revealed that both indices were higher for banana and equaled 1.21 and 0.68, respectively, implying that the studied banana production system had lower exergy loss and thus it was more exergy-efficient. The optimization results showed that both investigated indices noticeably enhanced in the optimized mode. More specifically, Cumulative Degree of Perfection was increased in banana, mango, jujube, guava, and sapodilla production systems to 2.72, 0.42, 0.56, 0.41, 0.53, respectively. In conclusion, the results approved that managing the inputs consumption would lead to reducing the consumption of non-renewable and chemical inputs in line with improving the energy and exergy use efficiency in tropical crops production systems.

AB With the increasing global demand for fresh food, the importance of the mass agri-producing countries has also increased. Agri-production has undergone a significant transformation from traditional practices to precise practices with the help of new technologies such as the IoT, big data, and GIS. However, the impact of such precision on the overall supply chain is insufficient due to the low adaptability of these expensive technologies. Fuzzy logic, known for being able to handle uncertainty in different fields of science and technology, may be able to address the highly uncertain factors of the agri-supply chain, such as the soil content, rainfall, humidity, and production and yield prediction. Thus, this study reviews fuzzy applications in the agri-supply chain considering land suitability, production techniques, irrigation, cold storage deficiencies, transportation, waste management, environmental and sustainability issues, and drought management and establishes an integrated framework. The integrated framework, which aims to analyse the overall supply chain performance, finally concludes that there is a lack of efficient knowledge-based models in the domain. Thus, using collaborative fuzzy applications with big data and GIS with a higher degree of heuristic and meta-heuristic simulations in the agri-supply chain can develop more robust models.

AB The life cycle assessment and environmental impacts of a 1000MW coal-fired power plant were carried out in this paper. The results showed that the operation energy consumption and pollutant emission of the power plant are the highest in all sub-process, which accounts for 93.93% of the total energy consumption and 92.20% of the total emission. Compared to other pollutant emissions from the coal-fired power plant, CO2 reached up to 99.28%. Therefore, the control of CO2 emission from the coal-fired power plants was very important. Based on the BP neural network, the amount of CO2 emission from the generation side of coal-fired power plants was calculated via carbon balance method. The results showed that unit capacity, coal quality and unit operation load had great influence on the CO2 emission from coal-fired power plants in Guangdong Province. The use of high volatile and high heat value of coal also can reduce the CO2 emissions. What's more, under higher operation load condition, the CO2 emissions of 1 kWh electric energy was less.

AB A sustainable chemicalindustry needs to quantify its emissionsand resource consumption by life cycle assessment (LCA). However,LCA requires detailed mass and energy balances, which are usuallynot available at early process development stages. Here, we introducea framework (A PROcess-specific, PRedictive impact AssessmenT method for Emerging chemical processes, APPROPRIATE) to provide a fullyautomated, predictive LCA framework for the early phases of processdevelopment. Based on Gaussian Process Regression, the framework isalready applicable at Technology Readiness Level 2. To overcome thelimited LCA data availability, we employ an encoder-decodernetwork in combination with transfer learning to achieve a latentrepresentation as a condensed molecular descriptor. We further proposeto integrate not only molecular but also process descriptors, e.g.,the stoichiometric sum of the reactants' impacts. Thereby,we can distinguish between process alternatives and incorporate changesin the background systems. The framework is compared to state-of-the-artpredictive LCA approaches and shows increased prediction accuracyin terms of the coefficient of determination of R (2) = 0.61 for the global warming impact compared to an R (2) = 0.3 in former studies. Highly relevant featuresare the stoichiometric sum of the reactants' impacts and thecondensed molecular descriptors. APPROPRIATE supports decision makingin early process development stages by allowing the distinction betweenprocess alternatives and quantifying predictions' uncertainty.
   The APPROPRIATE framework enables theprocess-specific predictionof environmental impacts by combining machine learning with processshort cuts.

AB Lane-changing (LC), which is one of the basic driving behavior, largely impacts on traffic efficiency and safety. Modeling an LC process is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainty of driving behavior. To address this issue, this paper proposes a data-driven LC model based on deep learning models. Deep belief network (DBN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network are employed to model the LC process that is composed of LC decisions (LCD) and LC implementation (LCI). The empirical LC data provided by Next Generation Simulation project (NGSIM) is utilized to train and test the proposed DBN-based LCD model and LSTM-based LCI model. The results indicate that the proposed data-driven model is able to accurately predict the LC process of a vehicle. The sensitivity analysis shows that the most important factor associated with LCD is the relative position of the preceding vehicle in the target lane. This may be the first work that comprehensively models LC using deep learning approaches.

AB At present, buildings in arid and hot regions are facing severe challenges of indoor comfort improvement and carbon emission reduction, especially in rural areas. Multi-objective optimization could be an effective tool for tackling the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a life-cycle optimization framework considering thermal comfort, which is beneficial to promoting residents' motivation for low-carbon retrofit in arid climate regions. First, in response to the above problems, three objective functions are specified in the framework, which are global warming potential (GWP), life cycle cost (LCC), and thermal discomfort hours (TDH). To improve the optimization efficiency, this research uses Deep Neural Networks (DNN) combined with NSGA-II to construct a high-precision prediction model (meta-model for optimization) based on the energy consumption simulation database formed by the orthogonal multi-dimensional design parameters. The accuracy index of the modified model is R-2 > 0.99, cv(RMSE) <= 1%, and NMBE <= 0.2%, which gets rid of the dilemma of low prediction accuracy of traditional machine learning models. In the scheme comparison and selection stage, the TOPSIS based on two empowerment methods is applied to meet different design tendencies, where the entropy-based method can avoid the interference of subjective preference and significantly improve the objectivity and scientific nature of decision analysis. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted on the variables, which supports guidance for practitioners to carry out the low-carbon design. Finally, the multi-objective optimization analysis for a farmhouse in Turpan is taken as a case study to evaluate the performance of the framework. The results show that the framework could significantly improve the building performance, with 60.8%, 52.5%, and 14.2% reduction in GWP, LCC, and TDH, respectively.

AB This study performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impact of chicken meat production from a Mexican case study, with a "cradle-to-slaughterhouse gate" approach. To overcome the LCA's limitations and provide a more holistic picture of the system, simulation and artificial intelligence techniques were integrated. First, raw material/energy requirements were obtained from the case study and simulated using Process simulation (PS) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to estimate the emissions and quantify their uncertainty. Then, IMPACT 2002 + was used to calculate the overall impact using Ecoinvent and LCA Food databases. The results highlight that chicken farms are the main factors responsible for the environmental impacts assessed, where feed production (use of chemicals and energy requirements) and on-farm emissions (organic waste decomposition) are the main contributors. Concerning the slaughterhouse, the energy production (electricity and steam) and the cooling-related activities present a significant impact. Afterwards, three impact allocation procedures (mass method, neural networks, and stepwise regression) were tested, showing similar results. Finally, a multiobjective optimization model based on a Genetic Algorithm was applied looking to minimize the environmental impacts and maximize the economic benefits. The selected alternative achieved a reduction of 15.14% per functional unit at the environmental indicators. The results encourage the use of support techniques for LCA to perform a reliable assessment and an environmental/economic optimization of the system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The recycling of construction waste is key to reducing waste generation and CO2 emissions. This study aimed to develop a quantitative model for analyzing the carbon reduction potential of recycling construction, demolition, and renovation waste (CDRW) in Jiangsu province. The waste generation rate calculation method and nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural network model were used to estimate and predict CDRW generation. The life cycle assessment was performed to calculate the carbon reduction potential of recycling CDRW. In quantifying the carbon reduction potential, not only construction and demolition waste, but also renovation waste was considered for the first time. The results showed that the total carbon reduction potential of recycling CDRW increased from 3.94 Mt CO(2)e in 2000 to 58.65 Mt CO(2)e in 2020. Steel and concrete were the main contributors. By scenario analysis, the carbon reduction potential of fully recycling CDRW in 2020 increased by 37.79 Mt CO(2)e, a growth rate of 64%. The study further predicts future CDRW generation and the corresponding carbon reduction potential. Our conclusions indicate that 245.45 Mt of CDRW will be generated in 2030, and carbon reduction potential may reach 82.36 Mt CO(2)e. These results will help the government manage construction waste better and reach early achievement of the carbon peak target.

AB Hydrogen (H-2) liquefaction is one of the most promising approaches for storing and transporting clean energy on a large scale for long periods. However, this strategy faces the challenges of high energy consumption, relatively low exergy efficiency, substantial economic costs, boil-off gas losses, and limited knowledge of its environmental perspectives. A robust systematic framework is introduced by integrating thermodynamic, machine learning (ML), and multiobjective optimization (MOO) approaches to optimize the operational variables of the H-2 liquefaction process. The H-2 liquefaction process includes a mixed refrigerant precooling unit and a Joule-Brayton cryogenic cascade cycle. The combination of the pinch analysis approach and enumerative algorithms is used in the initial optimization phase as a nonlinear method to determine the operational variables of the precooling and liquefaction systems. The exergy efficiency and exergy destruction of H-2 liquefaction cycles are calculated as 49% and 5073 kW to produce 50 tons/day of liquid H-2. Based on life cycle assessment and economic analysis, the global warming and levelized cost to produce 1 kg liquid H-2 are calculated at 124 kgCO(2)eq and 4.833 US$, respectively. The sensitivity analysis, ML, and MOO algorithms (particle swarm, genetic algorithm, and gray wolf techniques) in the final optimization phase are used to determine the Pareto frontier. The multicriteria decision techniques are used to identify the optimal operating conditions considering the thermodynamic, economic, and environmental aspects. The uncertainty levels of objective functions based on different parameters are studied by uncertainty quantification using Monte Carlo.

AB The volume of construction work in the GCC countries is dramatically increasing, which poses challenges on energy demand and the environment. The building construction sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the largest and fastest in the GCC states. It is estimated that 2.32 million new homes are to be built by 2020 in order to meet the demand of growing population. This article provides a comprehensive picture of the initiatives and research progress in energy conservation and management in the Saudi Arabian building sector. Starting with a background of energy scenario, the article covers the policy-level measures and research and development activities reported so far, and compares the current situation with the global trends. This review reveals that even though there are promising research activities, policy supports and growing public awareness, the Kingdom has wide scope for further developments in order to ensure (through the utilization of its resources at their fullest potential) that all the viable state-of-the-art technologies for energy conservation and management in buildings are implemented. Accordingly, a consolidated outline of the key areas in the domain is presented, and many potential new research directions are proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water quality assessment is an important foundation of water resource protection and is affected by many indicators. The dynamic and fuzzy changes of water quality lead to problems for proper assessment. This paper explores a method which is in accordance with the water quality changes. The proposed method is based on the variable fuzzy pattern recognition (VFPR) model and combines the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model with the entropy weight (EW) method. The proposed method was applied to dynamically assess the water quality of Biliuhe Reservoir (Dailan, China). The results show that the water quality level is between levels 2 and 3 and worse in August or September, caused by the increasing water temperature and rainfall. Weights and methods are compared and random errors of the values of indicators are analyzed. It is concluded that the proposed method has advantages of dynamism, fuzzification and stability by considering the interval influence of multiple indicators and using the average level characteristic values of four models as results.

AB The viability of using recycled coarse aggregate (RA) and demolished concrete lumps (DCLs) in manufacturing concrete products have been demonstrated in previous studies and practical applications but their environmental impacts have not been compared. In this study, we conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) on prefabricated components made from three recycling strategies, including the recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) strategy (only using RA), the recycled lump concrete (RLC) strategy (only using DCLs), and the recycled lump/aggregate concrete (RLAC) strategy (simultaneously using DCLs and RA). To identify the environmental impacts of these strategies, twenty-four designed scenarios were investigated with a varying RA replacement ratio (0%, 30%, 50%, and 70%), a changing DCL replacement ratio (0%, 20%, and 30%), and two targeted compressive strength of structural component (25 MPa and 35 MPa). An artificial neural network was implemented to estimate the raw materials consumption of those 24 scenarios. In our LCA, the environmental impacts were evaluated through four indicators. The numerical results show that the RLC and RLAC strategies exhibit a relatively lower environmental burden than the RAC strategy among all scenarios due to the utilization of DCLs. Sensitivity analysis also proved that the location of the recycling plant is a critical factor in the selection of the recycling strategy for an optimal environmental benefit. Our study confirmed the advantage of simultaneously using DCLs and RA in the design and fabrication of recycled concrete products from an environmental perspective, paving the way to further exploit the RLAC product as an alternative solution for a sustainable built environment in the near future.

AB The design of a high-performance building necessitates tradeoffs among multiple performance objectives, and many simulation-based optimization tools have been developed for this purpose. In practice, these tools are often constrained by excessive computational load and tight project deadlines. This study aimed to develop a holistic approach to rapidly identify optimal building design schemes. A novel two-stage model was developed as a surrogate to conventional physics-based models, which were then linked to multi-objective optimization algorithms, namely, NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and C-TAEA, in search of the Pareto optimal and best design schemes. The performance of the two-stage model was further enhanced by applying the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Neural Architecture Search methods and learning from the statistical layer. The above approach was tested in the design of an apartment building for seniors in Northern China such as thermal comfort, carbon, and cost. The optimal design achieved through the compromise optimum can significantly reduce thermal discomfort, life-cycle carbon emissions, and high levels of daylighting conditions. The design scheme was visualized using a geometrical remodel module. This study contributes methodologically to complex multi-objective building optimization problems with practical implications for design.

AB To achieve carbon neutrality, the power structure is bound to usher in fundamental transformations. In this study, an energy-carbon-water nexus (F-ECWN) system model is developed to assess trade-offs among different decision-making objectives within a power system under varying policy orientations. The model incorporates forecast data derived from various global climate models, leverages neural network prediction, draws upon multi-criteria decision-making theory, and incorporates fuzzy theory. Moreover, to effectively handle a multitude of fuzzy parameters within the model, a novel dual-interval algorithm for solving fuzzy linear programming is proposed. The F-ECWN model has the capability to derive the fuzzy membership function for each variable within the model ensuring that errors remain below 1 %, reflecting the uncertainty stemming from diverse policy orientations and technology choices. Various scenarios were formulated to gauge the impact of policy orientation on the allocation decisions of regional energy systems. Additionally, sensitivity analysis has been conducted to assess the effects of uncertain parameters on modeling outputs. The results of the applied research in Fujian Province have revealed that the presence of uncertainties in the energy system's parameters can significantly influence model outputs and decision-making processes. Furthermore, the modeling results demonstrate the region's substantial potential for reducing carbon emissions. Under optimal policy guidance and climate con-ditions, the total carbon emissions can be reduced by 65 %, with a 36.14 % increase in the total system cost. These findings are anticipated to provide valuable support for formulating optimal decisions regarding regional energy-carbon-water nexus system and related environmental policies.

AB This paper attempts to conduct a comparative life cycle environmental analysis of alternative versions of a product that was manu-factured with the use of additive technologies. The aim of the paper was to compare the environmental assessment of an additive-manufactured product using two approaches: a traditional one, based on the use of SimaPro software, and the authors' own concept of a newly developed artificial intelligence (AI) based approach. The structure of the product was identical and the research experiments consisted in changing the materials used in additive manufacturing (from polylactic acid (PLA) to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)). The effects of these changes on the environmental factors were observed and a direct comparison of the effects in the different factors was made. SimaPro software with imple-mented databases was used for the analysis. Missing information on the environmental impact of additive manufacturing of PLA and ABS parts was taken from the literature for the purpose of the study. The novelty of the work lies in the results of a developing concurrent approach based on AI. The results showed that the artificial intelligence approach can be an effective way to analyze life cycle assessment (LCA) even in such complex cases as a 3D printed medical exoskeleton. This approach, which is becoming increasingly useful as the complexity of manufactured products increases, will be developed in future studies.

AB Agriculture plays an important role in sustaining all human activities. Major challenges such as overpopulation, competition for resources poses a threat to the food security of the planet. In order to tackle the ever-increasing complex problems in agricultural production systems, advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture offers important tools to address agricultural sustainability challenges. Data analytics hold the key to ensure future food security, food safety, and ecological sustainability. Disruptive information and communication technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain can address several problems such as productivity and yield improvement, water conservation, ensuring soil and plant health, and enhance environmental stewardship. The current study presents a systematic review of machine learning (ML) applications in agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Ninety three research papers were reviewed based on the applications of different ML algorithms in different phases of the ASCs. The study highlights how ASCs can benefit from ML techniques and lead to ASC sustainability. Based on the study findings an ML applications framework for sustainable ASC is proposed. The framework identifies the role of ML algorithms in providing real-time analytic insights for pro-active data-driven decision-making in the ASCs and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of ASCs for improved agricultural productivity and sustainability.

AB CONTEXT: Agricultural crop and livestock production systems are complex, essential to human well-being, and fraught with sustainability challenges. In light of intrinsic variability in agricultural production systems and the high number of decision variables, decision support for optimization of sustainability outcomes should be supported by rigorous operations research. OBJECTIVE: Several operations research (OR) methods such as evolutionary algorithms, multi-objective optimization, and data envelopment analysis (DEA) have been applied to optimization in agricultural contexts, taking into account different objective functions and decision variables, and life cycle-based evaluation of environmental outcomes in agriculture have become widespread. The current review evaluates the methods used for optimization of agricultural and livestock systems for life cycle-based environmental sustainability goals. METHODS: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) systematic review method and three complementary search strategies were used to identify relevant articles. Strengths, weaknesses, and performance issues for each method are considered and compared. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Farm benchmarking, output prediction and resource use management are the three most commonly considered decision types in crop-livestock production systems. To guide selection and implementation of appropriate OR methods, a framework (decision tree) is proposed.

AB PurposeDespite the growing interest in closed-loop manufacturing, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate product development, production processes, people and policies (4Ps) to optimize sustainable manufacturing performance. This study investigates the influence of the four Ps of closed-loop manufacturing systems (product development, production processes, people and policies) on sustainable manufacturing performance (SMP).Design/methodology/approachTo investigate the influence of the four Ps on SMP, a hybrid analytical model was employed, combining structural equation modeling (SEM) with artificial neural networks (ANN). Data were collected through a structured survey administered to 353 manufacturing firms in Malaysia. SEM was used to assess the relationships between the variables, while ANN was employed to capture nonlinear relationships and improve prediction accuracy.FindingsThe research findings demonstrate that product development practices, including eco-design, life cycle assessment and resource planning, exert the most significant influence on SMP. Furthermore, implementing green and lean manufacturing techniques, energy modeling and material utilization/toxicity planning significantly enhances sustainability outcomes. While the social setting (employee motivation, turnover and work-life quality) does not directly impact SMP, it plays a pivotal role in facilitating the implementation of internal environmental policies. Moreover, environmental management practices, both mandatory and voluntary, serve as intermediaries between the four Ps and SMP within closed-loop manufacturing systems.Practical implicationsThe findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, industry leaders and manufacturing organizations. By prioritizing product development, implementing green and lean manufacturing practices and fostering a positive social setting, organizations can significantly enhance their sustainable performance. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of effective environmental management practices in mediating the relationship between other factors and SMP.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the factors that drive sustainable manufacturing performance. The hybrid SEM-ANN model offers a robust and innovative approach to analyzing the complex relationships between the four Ps and SMP.

AB The real-world urban systems represent nonlinear, dynamical, and interconnected urban processes that require better management of their complexity. Thereby, we need to understand, measure, and assess the structure and functioning of the urban processes. We propose an innovative and novel evidence-based methodology to manage the complexity of urban processes, that can enhance their resilience as part of the concept of smart and regenerative urban metabolism with the overarching intention to better achieve sustainability. We couple Life Cycle Thinking and Machine Learning to measure and assess the metabolic processes of the urban core of Lisbon's functional urban area using multidimensional indicators and measures incorporating urban ecosystem services dynamics. We built and trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network to identify the metabolic drivers and predict the metabolic changes for the near future (2025). The prediction model's performance was validated using the standard deviations of the prediction errors of the data subsets and the network's training graph. The simulated results show that the urban processes related to employment and unemployment rates (17%), energy systems (10%), sewage and waste management/treatment/recycling, demography & migration, hard/soft cultural assets, and air pollution (7%), education and training, welfare, cultural participation, and habitat ecosystems (5%), urban safety, water systems, economy, housing quality, urban void, urban fabric, and health services and infrastructure (2%), consists the salient drivers for the urban metabolic changes. The proposed research framework acts as a knowledge-based tool to support effective urban metabolism policies ensuring sustainable and resilient urban development.

AB Technical management of agricultural units plays an important role in increasing the yield, energy efficiency, and decreasing the production costs. Based on that, the present study aimed to evaluate and optimize the technical and economic efficiency in Saffron farms in the 2019-20 cropping season in Iran. Required data were collected from 70 Saffron farms through interviews and questionnaires and were analyzed and compared using two optimization methods including data envelopment analysis (DEA), and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). Based on the results related to the energy section, the total energy input was obtained as 43,578 MJ ha(-1) before any optimization, while it was determined as 36,033 and 36,910 MJ ha(-1) after optimization using DEA, and MOGA, respectively. Also DEA and MOGA methods improved the energy ratio index (ER) (0.002) by 50, and 159%, respectively. Results related to the economic section showed that the total production costs were mitigated from 1260 $ ha(-1) to 863.5 and 1069 $ ha(-1) after optimization by DEA, and MOGA, respectively. After optimization of revenue (using MOGA method), and total costs (using MOGA, and DEA), the benefit cost ratio index was improved from 1.43 to 2.09 (using DEA), and 3.3 (using MOGA). Consequently, MOGA optimization method showed better results compared to DEA in both energy and economic sections.

AB The development of information technologies has been exponentially applied to the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries. The extent of the literature reveals that the two most pertinent technologies are building information modeling (BIM) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The radical digitization of the AEC industry, enabled by BIM and AI, has contributed to the emergence of "smart cities", which uses information technology to improve urban operational and sustainable efficiency. Few studies have investigated the roles of AI and BIM in AEC from the perspective of sustainable buildings in assisting designers to make sustainable decisions at building and city levels. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the research status and future development trends in the relationship between AI and BIM-aided sustainable building in the context of the smart city to provide researchers, designers, and technology developers with potential research directions. This paper adopted a macro and micro bibliographic method, which is used to map out the general research landscape. This is followed by a more in-depth analysis of the fields of sustainable design, sustainable construction, sustainable development, and life cycle assessment (LCA). The results show that the combination of AI and BIM helps to make optimal decisions on materials, cost, energy, construction scheduling, and monitoring and promotes the development of sustainable buildings in both technical and human aspects so to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 7 (ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable modern energy for all), 9 (building resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industries, and foster innovation), 11 (building inclusive, safe, risk-resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements), and 12 (ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns). In addition, the combination of AI, BIM, and LCA technologies offers great potential to improve building performance, and the future development of AI and BIM integration should not only consider the sustainability of buildings but also consider the human-centered design concept and the health, safety, and comfort of stakeholders as one of the goals to realize the multidimensional development of smart city based on city information model.

AB As more companies and researchers become interested in understanding the relationship between product design decisions and eventual environmental impact, proposed methods have explored meeting this demand. However, there are currently limited methods available for use in the early design phase to help quantify the environmental impact of making design decisions. Current methods, primarily vetted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods, require the designer to wait until later in the design phase, when a product's design is more defined; alternatively, designers are resigned to relying on prior sustainable design experience and empirical knowledge. There is a clear need to develop methods that quantitatively inform designers of the environmental impact of design decisions during the early design phase (particularly during concept generation), as this allows for reexamination of decisions before they become costly or time-intensive to change. The current work builds on previous research involving the development of a search tree of sustainable design knowledge, which, applied during the early design phase, helps designers hone in on the impact of product design decisions. To assist in quantifying the impact of these design decisions, the current work explores the development of a weighting system associated with each. potential design decision. The work presented in this paper aims to quantify the general environmental impact potential design decisions have on a consumer product, by using a multi-layer perceptron neural network with back propagation training-a method of machine learning-to relate the life-cycle assessment impact of 37 case study products to product attributes. By defining the relationship between LCA data and product attributes, designers in the early design phase will be more informed of which product attributes have the largest environmental impact, such that the designer can redesign the product to have reduce this impact.

AB A promising pathway towards sustainable transaction to clean energy production lies in the adoption of solar assisted district heating systems (SDHS). However, SDHS technical barriers during their design and operation phases, combined with their economic limitation, promote a high variation in quantifying SDHS benefits over their lifetime. This study proposes a complete multi-objective optimization framework using a robust machine learning approach to inherent sustainability principles in the design of SDHS. Moreover, the framework investigates the uncertainty in the context of SDHS design, in which the Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is combined with the heuristics optimization approach. The framework application is illustrated through a case study for the optimal integration of SHDS at different urban community sizes (10, 25, 50, and 100 buildings) located in Madrid. The results reveal a substantial improvement in economic and environmental benefits for deploying SDHS, especially with including the seasonal storage tank (SST) construction properties in the optimization problem, and it can achieve a payback period up to 13.7 years. In addition, the solar fraction of the optimized SDHS never falls below 82.1% for the investigated community sizes with an efficiency above 69.5% for the SST. Finally, the GSA indicates the SST investment cost and its relevant construction materials, are primarily responsible for the variability in the optimal system feasibility. The proposed framework can provide a good starting point to solve the enormous computational expenses drawbacks associated with the heuristics optimization approach. Furthermore, it can function as a decision support tool to fulfill the European Union energy targets regarding clean energy production.

AB This study performs techno-economic analysis and Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) to explore the effects that variations in biomass feedstock quality have on the economic feasibility of fast pyrolysis biorefineries using decentralized preprocessing sites (i.e., depots that produce pellets). Two biomass resources in the Southeastern United States, that is, pine residues and switchgrass, were examined as feedstocks. A scenario analysis was conducted for an array of different combinations, including different pellet ash control levels, feedstock blending ratios, different biorefinery capacities, and different biorefinery on-stream capacities, followed by a comparison with the traditional centralized system. MCS results show that, with depot preprocessing, variations in the feedstock moisture and feedstock ash content can be significantly reduced compared with a traditional centralized system. For a biorefinery operating at 100% of its designed capacity, the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of the decentralized system is $3.97-$4.39 per gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE) based on the mean value across all scenarios, whereas the mean MFSP for the traditional centralized system was $3.79-$4.12/GGE. To understand the potential benefits of highly flowable pellets in decreasing biorefinery downtime due to feedstock handling and plugging problems, this study also compares the MFSP of the decentralized system at 90% of its designed capacity with a traditional system at 80%. The analysis illustrates that using low ash pellets mixed with switchgrass and pine residues generates a more competitive MFSP. Specifically, for a biorefinery designed for 2,000 oven dry metric ton per day, running a blended pellet made from 75% switchgrass and 25% pine residues with 2% ash level, and operating at 90% of designed capacity could make an MFSP between $4.49 and $4.71/GGE. In contrast, a traditional centralized biorefinery operating at 80% of designed capacity marks an MFSP between $4.72 and $5.28.

AB Developing coal to hydrogen is a crucial way to alleviate the conflict between demand and supply of hydrogen. A coal to hydrogen process based on ash agglomerating fluidized bed (AFB) gasification is carried out and simulated in this paper. Life cycle primary fossil energy consumption (PFEC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions analysis are carried out to provide theoretical guidance for the development of the coal to hydrogen process. Two scenarios, the coal to hydrogen process with CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and without CCS, are analyzed. The results show that the PFEC of the scenario with CCS is 2.32% higher than the corresponding value of the scenario without CCS, whereas the GHG emissions of the scenario with CCS are 81.72% lower than the corresponding value of the scenario without CCS. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis shows that life cycle PFEC and GHG emissions are sensitive to the hydrogen transport mode and hydrogen transport distance. Suggestions are also proposed for the development of the coal to hydrogen process based on AFB gasification. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although there has been considerable interest in innovative architectural and technical solutions for energy rehabilitation of housing, there has been less focus on environmental rehabilitation, which requires more rigorous processes and approaches to minimise environmental impact. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating the environmental performances of traditional Saharan single-family houses and contemporary European multi-family dwellings, in arid and oceanic-continental climates. The assessment was conducted using a multi-criteria indicator system based on a mathematical model and combining four impact categories (cumulative energy demand, resource depletion, greenhouse effect and smog), five indices (thermal, energy, environmental, morphological and metabolic) and four scenarios. The study indicates that the use of low-energy heating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and appropriate thermal zoning with insulated walls can reduce the heating demand of dwellings in oceanic-continental climates by 33.5% and 12% respectively. Additionally, the use of stone in the same climate can reduce the initial requirements of the baseline variant by up to 36.5%. The strategies employed ensured environmental optimization, along with a closed island morphology featuring offsets ranging from 0 to 45% from the reference. In arid climates, standard masonry optimized the energy performance of Saharan dwellings, reducing their heating needs by 31% and their cooling needs by 35%. This strategy, along with the patio and a closed island morphology, optimised their environmental performance, with reference offsets ranging from 0 to 41%. A tool has been developed to promote sustainable development in the built environment by enhancing codes and regulations for sustainable construction and rehabilitation operations.

ID CLASSIFIER SELECTION
AB Automatic anomaly detection monitoring plays a vital role in water utilities' distribution systems to reduce the risk posed by unclean water to consumers. One of the major problems with anomaly detection is imbalanced datasets. Dynamic selection techniques combined with ensemble models have proven to be effective for imbalanced datasets classification tasks. In this paper, water quality anomaly detection is formulated as a classification problem in the presences of class imbalance. To tackle this problem, considering the asymmetry dataset distribution between the majority and minority classes, the performance of sixteen previously proposed single and static ensemble classification methods embedded with resampling strategies are first optimised and compared. After that, six dynamic selection techniques, namely, Modified Class Rank (Rank), Local Class Accuracy (LCA), Overall-Local Accuracy (OLA), K-Nearest Oracles Eliminate (KNORA-E), K-Nearest Oracles Union (KNORA-U) and Meta-Learning for Dynamic Ensemble Selection (META-DES) in combination with homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble models and three SMOTE-based resampling algorithms (SMOTE, SMOTE+ENN and SMOTE+Tomek Links), and one missing data method (missForest) are proposed and evaluated. A binary real-world drinking-water quality anomaly detection dataset is utilised to evaluate the models. The experimental results obtained reveal all the models benefitting from the combined optimisation of both the classifiers and resampling methods. Considering the three performance measures (balanced accuracy, F-score and G-mean), the result also shows that the dynamic classifier selection (DCS) techniques, in particular, the missForest+SMOTE+RANK and missForest+SMOTE+OLA models based on homogeneous ensemble-bagging with decision tree as the base classifier, exhibited better performances in terms of balanced accuracy and G-mean, while the Bg+mF+SMENN+LCA model based on homogeneous ensemble-bagging with random forest has a better overall F1-measure in comparison to the other models.

AB Water, energy and environment are inextricably linked, and exhibit a close nexus with crop production, ecosystem sustainability and food security. Chemical fertilizers and irrigation water were the major hot spots of water and energy footprints, with significant impact on carbon (C) footprints that largely impacts ecosystem sustainability. The non-renewable energy (NRE) shared similar to 59-92%, while renewable energy (RE) comprised similar to 8-41% of total energy input (E-I) in field crops. The direct energy (DE) and indirect energy (IDE) sources comprised similar to 10-74% and 26-90% of E-I, respectively. In vegetable and fruit crops, the RE and NRE shared similar to 1.4-24% and 76-98.6%, whilst the DE and IDE sources shared similar to 14-90% and 10-86% of E-I. The energy ratio varied between 1.49-5.00 for rice, 1.75-7.50 for wheat, 3.80-7.41 for maize and 0.70-4.80 for cotton ecosystems. The corresponding specific energy ranged between 6.4-16.7, 4.0-8.42, 3.80-6.93 and 4.99-19.2 MJ kg(-1), respectively. The greenhouse gases emission in crop production was related linearly to E-I in crop production and was substantially decreased under optimized production situations. The study highlights the need of intensified agricultural extension efforts to disseminate the robust technological interventions for resource use optimization for decreased energy and C footprints in crop production for long-term system sustainability. The artificial neural networks and adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference system of variable complexity viz. single and multi-layered sub-networks developed for various crops in different agro-ecological regions could be highly helpful to the researchers and policymakers for designing future strategies for enhancing ecosystems' resilience and environmental sustainability.

TI Detection and Discrimination of Tea Plant Stresses Based on

AB Tea plant stresses threaten the quality of tea seriously. The technology corresponding to the fast detection and differentiation of stresses is of great significance for plant protection in tea plantation. In recent years, hyperspectral imaging technology has shown great potential in detecting and differentiating plant diseases, pests and some other stresses at the leaf level. However, the lack of studies at canopy level hampers the detection of tea plant stresses at a larger scale. In this study, based on the canopy-level hyperspectral imaging data, the methods for identifying and differentiating the three commonly occurred tea stresses (i.e., the tea leafhopper, anthrax and sun burn) were studied. To account for the complexity of the canopy scenario, a stepwise detecting strategy was proposed that includes the process of background removal, identification of damaged areas and discrimination of stresses. Firstly, combining the successive projection algorithm (SPA) spectral analysis and K-means cluster analysis, the background and overexposed non-plant regions were removed from the image. Then, a rigorous sensitivity analysis and optimization were performed on various forms of spectral features, which yielded optimal features for detecting damaged areas (i.e., YSV, Area, GI, CARL and NBNDVI) and optimal features for stresses discrimination (i.e., MCARI, CI, LCI, RARS, TCI and VOG). Based on this information, the models for identifying damaged areas and those models for discriminating different stresses were established using K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Fisher discriminant analysis. The identification model achieved an accuracy over 95%, and the discrimination model achieved an accuracy over 93% for all stresses. The results suggested the feasibility of stress detection and differentiation using canopy-level hyperspectral imaging techniques, and indicated the potential for its extension over large areas.

AB This paper deals with the postgraduate course 'Predictive and optimisation models for concrete structures', offered at the Masters in Concrete Engineering of the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia. Within this course, engineering students are introduced into different optimization algorithms, such as simulated annealing, neural networks, genetic algorithms, etc. of application in the automated design of concrete structures of any type. In recent times, such heuristic methods have turned out to be of great interest in the resolution of complex and actual engineering problems, such as the sustainable design and management of structures.
   This communication presents a case study where the ongoing research of the teaching body is applied so as to find the most sustainable management strategy for a particular bridge system consisting of 7 bridges whose lengths vary between 380 m and 1980 m. The optimization problem here aims to minimize both the economic and environmental life cycle impacts derived from the maintenance of the concrete decks of a bridge network by selecting the adequate maintenance intervals for every deck considering annual budgetary restrictions. A multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm is applied to find the set of Pareto optimal solutions for the presented engineering problem. The environmentally preferable maintenance strategy results in life cycle costs 4.9% greater than those related to the cost-optimal strategy, which in turn results in environmental impacts 5.6% greater than those from the environmentally optimized management option. Results are then compared to the optimal strategies considering a single bridge deck, showing that the optimality at the bridge level does not necessarily lead to a sustainable optimum at the network level. From this it follows that, when optimizing maintenance under budgetary restrictions, the network shall be analysed as a whole, and not as an aggregation of optimal strategies for each individual bridge. The case study presented here shows in a nutshell the close connection between the course curricula of the MSc course and the ongoing research of the teaching and research group.

AB Rapid analysis and processing of large quantities of data obtained from in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM) experiments can save researchers from the burdensome manual analysis work. The method mentioned in this paper combines deep learning and computer vision technology to realize the rapid automatic processing of end-to-end crystal high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images, which has great potential in assisting TEM image analysis. For the fine-grained result, the HRTEM image is divided into multiple patches by sliding window, and 2D fast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed, and then all FFT images are inputted into the designed LCA-Unet to extract bright spots. LCA-Unet combines local contrast and attention mechanism on the basis of U-net. Even if the bright spots in FFT images are weak, the proposed neural network can extract bright spots effectively. Using computer vision and the information of bright spots above mentioned, the automatic FFT pattern recognition is completed by three steps. First step is to calculate the precise coordinates of the bright spots, the lattice spacings and the inter-plane angles in each patch. Second step is to match the lattice spacing and the angles with the powder diffraction file (PDF) to determine the material phase of each patch. Third step is to merge the patches with same phase. Taking the HRTEM image of zirconium and its oxide nanoparticles as an example, the results obtained by the proposed method are basically consistent with manual identification. Thus the approach could be used to automatically and effectively find the phase region of interest. It takes about 3 s to process a 4 K x 4 K HRTEM image on a modern desktop computer with NVIDIA GPU.

AB Additive Manufacturing (AM) has been regarded as a technology with disruptive potential, offering the possibility of substantial reductions in the environmental footprint. The predominant approach to quantitatively evaluate AM's environmental impacts relies heavily on the knowledge-intensive and time-consuming Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. To enable a faster design iteration cycle and alleviate the knowledge requirements of LCA modeling, the availability of an automated LCA tool could mark a remarkable leap forward in further enhancing AM's environmental performance. An emerging solution to achieve this goal is the combination of Machine Learning (ML) with LCA, the effectiveness of which has been initially demonstrated outside the AM domain. To explore the feasibility of predictive LCA for AM, this paper proposes a novel data-driven framework that integrates ML, product-process codesign, and LCA to support the environmental impact prediction of AM. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by taking the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process as a case study. This work introduces three main contributions to the research community. First, a training dataset comprising 200 data entries, where each entry encompasses 5 design features, 7 process features, and 18 environmental impact categories is constructed. Second, through a two-stage process involving correlation analysis and an ML preliminary study, the initial 12 design-process parameters are refined to 7 key influential features. Lastly, the refined set of features and 7 different ML algorithms are employed to develop a data-driven LCA (DD-LCA) model for the FFF process. Notably, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms demonstrate good performance with a prediction accuracy of 98% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.029. The developed model exhibits good generalizability when tested on new data. The paper concludes by addressing its limitations and outlining future research work.

AB IntroductionSo far, many studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of input consumption patterns on energy, economic, and environmental indicators on horticultural and greenhouse crops in Iran. A review of these studies shows that the causes of the current situation in the systems have not been investigated. These studies are mostly reporting the current situation and the interventions and their effect on improving the input consumption pattern in the sustainability of the system have not been considered by researchers. Also, studies showed that the study location and products do not fit well with the volume of production in the horticultural and greenhouse sector of Iran. Therefore, in order to increase the effectiveness and future direction of studies in this field, this review study was conducted. In this article, Iranian horticultural and greenhouse production systems were reviewed and analyzed by reviewing the published articles between 2008 and 2018, using the PRISMA method. The PRISMA method is a well-known method for conducting systematic review studies. The PRISMA method includes the following sections: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions, and implications of key findings. In this article, 16 types of garden products and 6 types of greenhouse products were studied.Material and Methods In this study, the methods used to determine the status of energy consumption, economic and environmental patterns for horticultural and greenhouse crops were analyzed. For this purpose, the indicators of total energy consumption (TEI), energy efficiency (EUE), net energy (NE), and energy efficiency (EP) were examined in the section of energy. The issue of sensitivity analysis of energy inputs was also examined and the highest values of t-statistic and MPP were reported for products. In some articles, the data envelopment analysis method was used in systems performance analysis. The indicators used included technical efficiency (TE), pure technical efficiency (PTE), scale efficiency (SE), and energy-saving target ratio (ESTR). The results of them were summarized and reported. In some studies, the method of artificial neural networks and the Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System were used. In general, in the present article, the challenges and risks in the methods used in previous studies were considered. The issue of sampling in the analysis of agricultural systems was discussed in detail and a new sampling procedure was proposed. To draw a general picture of energy and environmental indicators of orchard and greenhouse systems in Iran, the results published in the articles were reviewed. Not all researchers use the same equivalents in calculating the indices, and this makes the results of the studies slightly different from each other. The existence of such differences causes some deviations in comparing the results of similar articles in the same products. However, to adjust for these differences, averaging was used in the index report.Results and DiscussionThe study of the share of inputs in the total energy consumption shows that for horticultural products, the share of fertilizer and electricity inputs is very significant. In the case of greenhouse products, fuel input, which is mainly diesel, has the largest share of energy consumption. Walnuts have the lowest energy consumption and strawberries have the highest energy consumption among orchard products.
   Grapes, apples, and walnuts also have positive net energy, so they have the highest energy efficiency compared to other products. The most important inputs that have the greatest potential for energy savings in most products are diesel fuel and electricity. Among greenhouse crops in cucumber production, diesel fuel has great potential for energy savings that need to be reduced in future research. In the case of strawberry and rose products, electricity input has the greatest potential for energy savings. Knowing the potential of inputs that can be saved can be effective in changing the behavior of producers.Conclusion To increase the effectiveness of research in this area, such studies should be done dynamically and for at least two or more years. In the first year, the input consumption pattern should be extracted and after performing the consumption pattern modifying interventions, the effect of these actions should be evaluated in the following years. Data envelopment analysis methods and multi-objective genetic algorithm can be well used to develop solutions to improve input consumption patterns. The review of articles showed that the study of the effect of social factors on the behavior of various production systems has been neglected. Since the pattern of energy consumption in the agricultural sector is significantly dependent on the behavior of users and the characteristics of systems and methods of production, it seems necessary to pay attention to this factor to prepare and design any process improvement strategy in the system. In this study, a new procedure including three stages of analysis, redesign, and evaluation was proposed to complete the studies related to the analysis of agricultural systems.

AB Lung cancer (LCa) and gastric cancer (GCa) are two of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Unspecific clinical symptoms and the lack of defined risk factors often delay the diagnosis of the disease, which could high the mortality rate. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the capability of an electronic nose (e-nose) based on metal-oxide semi-conductor sensors combined with pattern recognition methods to discriminate between patients groups with LCa, GCa, and healthy controls (HC). Breath samples were collected from 35 volunteers containing 13 HC, 14 LCa, and 8 GCa patients. The e-nose dataset was treated with principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant function analysis (DFA), and support vector machines (SVM). As result, PCA and DFA have shown good discrimination between data-points of breath samples related to HC, LCa and GCa patients. The SVMs method reached a 100% success rate for the recognition of the analyzed three groups. In the light of these results, we can state that the presented e-nose system demonstrates that an inexpensive and non-invasive approach based on exhaled breath analysis could be considered a reliable screening tool to differentiate between the three studied groups.

AB Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is a valuable tool for filtering out non-influential model inputs. In combination with robustness, convergence and validation analyses, GSA can be particularly beneficial in interpreting and simplifying models with tens of thousands of independent inputs. However, there is lack of research on robust screening of such large models, where the curse of dimensionality can make existing analyses obsolete. We aim to close this gap by evaluating the computational performance of Spearman rank correlation coefficients, Sobol and delta indices, and gradient boosted trees regression. Numerical experiments are conducted for the Morris test function and a life cycle assessment model with 10'000 inputs each. Our results enable us to recommend a standardized procedure for higher-dimensional models which efficiently tests for model linearity, GSA screening, and convergence and robustness analyses of sensitivity indices, screening and rankings.

AB Lane changes made during traffic oscillations on freeways largely affect traffic safety and could increase collision potentials. Predicting the impacts of lane change can help to develop optimal lane change strategies of autonomous vehicles for safety improvement. The study aims at proposing a machine learning method for the short-term prediction of lane-changing impacts (LCI) during the propagation of traffic oscillations. The empirical lane changing trajectory records were obtained from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) platform. A support vector regression (SVR) model was trained in this study to predict the LCI on the crash risks and flow change using microscopic traffic variables such as individual speed, gap and acceleration on both original lanes and target lanes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in the SVR to quantify the contributions of correlative lane changing factors. The results showed that the trained SVR model achieved an accuracy of 72.81 % for the risk of crashes and 95.34 % in predicting the flow change. The sensitivity analysis explored the optimal speed and acceleration for the lane changer to achieve the lowest time integrated time-to-collision (TIT) value for safety maximization. Finally, we compared the LCI for motorcycles, automobiles and trucks as well as the LCI for both lane-changing directions (from left to right and from right to left). It was found that motorcycles conducted lane changes with smaller gaps and larger speed differences, which brings the highest crash risks. Passenger cars were found to be the safest when they conduct lane changes. Lane changes to the right had more negative impacts on traffic flow and crash risks.

AB Purpose: Among the methods of comprehensive analysis for a product or an enterprise, there exist defects and deficiencies in traditional standard cost analyses and life cycle assessment methods. For example, some methods only emphasize one dimension (such as economic or environmental factors) while neglecting other relevant dimensions. This paper builds a factor analysis model of resource value flow, based on full life cycle assessment and eco-design theory, in order to expose the relevant internal logic between these two factors.
   Design/methodology/approach: The model considers the efficient multiplication of resources, economic efficiency, and environmental efficiency as its core objectives. The model studies the status of resource value flow during the entire life cycle of a product, and gives an in-depth analysis on the mutual logical relationship of product performance, value, resource consumption, and environmental load to reveal the symptoms and potentials in different dimensions.
   Findings: This paper illustrates logical relationships among resource efficiency, economic efficiency and environmental efficiency, builds a fully comprehensive evaluation analysis model to trace, evaluate and analyze the status of the material and value flow of the product life cycle process.
   Originality/value: This provides comprehensive, accurate and timely decision-making information for enterprise managers regarding product eco-design, as well as production and management activities. To conclude, it verifies the availability of this evaluation and analysis model using a Chinese SUV manufacturer as an example.

AB In recent decades, environmental problems have enforced designers to estimate the level of environmental emission of building design and reduce their environmental impact. On the premise of ensuring indoor comfort, the cost-effectiveness of solutions for reducing the building's greenhouse gas has become a critical issue. Based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), this paper establishes a building performance trade-off framework for indoor thermal comfort, economics, and environmental implication. This framework consists of four parts: the establishment of the optimization model; sensitivity analysis; obtain of Pareto frontier solutions, and decision-making analysis. Optimization variables involve envelope type and some envelope physical parameters. The "design variables-building performances'' database is obtained by using building simulation software combined with the Latin hypercube sampling algorithm. Sensitivity analysis is used to extract the key factors affecting building performance. The designer can prioritize these key factors and it can reduce the uncertainty of building performance. A multi-objective optimization method coupling Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) and non-dominated sorting genetic (NSGA-II) algorithm is proposed to seek the trade-off between three performances (obtain Pareto frontier solutions). The Pareto solution provides a more comprehensive reference for the preferences of different stakeholders, and the set of alternative solutions is further shrunk. Finally, take a specific residential building in China's cold climate zone as a showcase of the trade-off framework. According to the obtained Pareto frontier solution, the solution set is shrunk to a certain range, and the distribution ranges of Life Cycle Costs, the greenhouse gas emissions, and the annual thermal discomfort hour ratio are 122.3-137.1 USD/m(2), 15.6-44.8 kg CO2/m(2), and 19.1-25.2%, respectively.

AB This article deals with two life cycle assessment methods; Attributional (LCA-A) and Consequential (LCA-C). The objective is to bring new perspectives in the field of Eco-design for different types of product applications, particularly in IT, on a macroscopic, conceptual scale, and through different operational tools. In another context, a first work of simplification of the LCAs has been done to be able to handle and test the relevance of the different applicable tools. This work is summered at the part 2.5 and 2.6. By linking the field of Eco-design to Artificial Intelligence (AI), more precisely to Deep Learning and Machine Learning, while using also mathematical algorithms, we have new perspectives to gives to the domain of LCA. The study is currently in its infancy and the algorithms still non-existent and to be developed

AB Purpose This paper reviews the state-of-the art research in life cycle assessment (LCA) applied to buildings. It focuses on current research trends, and elaborates on gaps and directions for future research. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify current research and applications of LCA in buildings. The proposed review methodology includes (i) identifying recent authoritative research publications using established search engines, (ii) screening and retaining relevant publications, and (iii) extracting relevant LCA applications for buildings and analyzing their underpinning research. Subsequently, several research gaps and limitations were identified, which have informed our proposed future research directions. Results and discussions This paper argues that humans can attenuate and positively control the impact of their buildings on the environment, and as such mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by a new generation of LCA methods and tools that are model based and continuously learn from real-time data, while informing effective operation and management strategies of buildings and districts. Therefore, the consideration of the time dimension in product system modeling is becoming essential to understand the resulting pollutant emissions and resource consumption. This time dimension is currently missing in life cycle inventory databases. A further combination of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models using time-dependent characterization factors can lead to more comprehensive and reliable LCA results. Conclusions and recommendations This paper promotes the concept of semantic-based dynamic (real-time) LCA, which addresses temporal and spatial variations in the local built and environmental ecosystem, and thus more effectively promotes a "cradle-to-grave-to-reincarnation" environmental sustainability capability. Furthermore, it is critical to leverage digital building resources (e.g., connected objects, semantic models, and artificial intelligence) to deliver accurate and reliable environmental assessments.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB LCA is viewed as one of the important techniques to assess the environmental impacts of products, especially during the whole of the life cycle towards a circular economy approach.
   In the electronics sector, where products undergo rapid technological advancements and complex supply chains, LCA plays a crucial role in promoting sustainability and guiding decision-making processes. On the one hand, the environmental sustainability of electronics like ICT, Consumer Electronics, micro-electronics and Network Equipment is affected by the huge missing data because of the complexity, variety, large number of components, and otherwise different suppliers around the world.
   A more accurate, reliable, and standard LCA data management is necessary to decrease risks in the Supply Chain, increase transparency and provide sustainable and circular Business Models for Electronic Products and ICT Services.
   Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), and particularly the advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have led to disruptive innovations in data modeling and other fields.
   To address this issue in the electronic industry, the integration of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) can transform precision assessment from data inventory to automated LCA modeling, and innovative methodologies for a cost-efficient data configuration.
   We provide a comprehensive overview of advances in the application of big data and AI technologies for LCA of electronics. We discuss key challenges in missing data and utilization for electronics and micro-electronics, offering strategic solutions.
   This novel AI-data approach helps organizations easily provide the missing data by integrating complex and disparate data sources across multiple distributed sources to give insights. Meanwhile, a dynamic big data discovery approach delivers more accurate and precious data for intelligent decisions. The intention is to provide the industry, LCA experts, and decision-makers with a more standardized, comprehensive, and reliable data ecosystem.

AB The accuracy of life cycle assessment (LCA) studies is often questioned due to the two grand challenges of life cycle inventory (LCI) modeling: (1) missing foreground flow data and (2) inconsistency in background data matching. Traditional mechanistic methods (e.g., process simulation) and existing machine learning (ML) methods (e.g., similarity-based selection methods) are inadequate due to their limitations in scalability and generalizability. The large language models (LLMs) are well-positioned to address these challenges, given the massive and diverse knowledge learned through the pretraining step. Incorporating LLMs into LCI modeling can lead to the automation of inventory data curation from diverse data sources and to the implementation of a multimodal analytical capacity. In this article, we delineated the mechanisms and advantages of LLMs to addressing these two grand challenges. We also discussed the future research to enhance the use of LLMs for LCI modeling, which includes the key areas such as improving retrieval augmented generation (RAG), integration with knowledge graphs, developing prompt engineering strategies, and fine-tuning pretrained LLMs for LCI-specific tasks. The findings from our study serve as a foundation for future research on scalable and automated LCI modeling methods that can provide more appropriate data for LCA calculations.

AB Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is a crucial tool for sustainable development, cleaner production, and policymaking globally. However, traditional static LCIA methods rely on fixed characterization factors, making it difficult to capture the dynamic changes in environmental impacts over time and space. This study uses an interpretable machine learning method to develop dynamic LCIA for assessing the spatiotemporal carcinogenic impact of coal power generation in China. The results show that the accuracy of the dynamic life cycle carcinogenic assessment (LCCA) outperforms the traditional LCCA. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the dynamic LCCA and cancer cases is 0.676, while that of the traditional LCCA is 0.556. The disease burden caused by pollutants released from coal power generation is spatiotemporal quantified based on dynamic LCCA, and results show that mercury pollutant emissions caused a cumulative disease burden of 661,062 DALYs from 2007 to 2016. Furthermore, the dynamic sensitivity analysis reveals the nonlinear response of disease burden to pollutant emissions. The sensitivity of disease burden to different pollutant emission levels is various, and the response of disease burden is more significant when the pollutant emission level is higher. This study supports the advancement of dynamic LCIA and sustainable environmental health.

AB The circular economy and its various recirculation loops have become a major study subject over recent years, particularly in the field of agriculture, which is a significant source of waste production. There have been several studies focused on transforming agricultural lignocellulosic waste with "sustainable" processes: economically viable, socially accepted, and environmentally friendly. Thanks to "life cycle thinking", it is possible to assess these potential environmental impacts. However, these environmental analyses generally require a massive volume of specific data, the collection of which can be time-consuming and tedious, or impossible to practice. On the other hand, scientific articles describing the processes for the valorization of agricultural by-products are intriguing but rarely exploited sources of data. In this paper, a hybridization of data science techniques and environmental analysis was proposed to improve life cycle analysis (LCA) thanks to Machine Learning (ML). ML part of the proposed approach is based on unsupervised learning, which is composed of two methods: dimension reduction using the Multidimensional Scaling and clustering technique using k-means. Composed of five steps and dedicated to researchers or R&D engineers, the approach is oriented towards offering a decision on technologies and processes for waste to energy in the early eco-design step. The case study in the domain of pre-treatment processes for corn stover and rice straw is detailed. The results show that all impacts that concern the chemical pollution of soil and water are found in the same cluster. Other impacts are detected in the same cluster which is related to the land use and the land transformation. In the same vein, two purely mechanical pre-treatments have been identified and grouped by Multidimensional Scaling and k-means.

The optimization methodology, programmed in MATLAB, is based on a formulation model of LCC and the environmental LCA, using data available from the Ecoinvent database, the OpenLCA software (V1.11.0), and other public databases. Results provide insights about the best combination of countries for acquiring raw materials to manufacture NiZn and for disposing of the waste of NiZn batteries that cannot be recycled. These results were automatically linked to some sustainability KPIs, such as global warming and capital costs, being replicable in case of data updates or changes in production or recycling locations, which were initially considered at Paris (France) and Krefeld (Germany), respectively. These results provided by an AI model were validated by using a sensitivity analysis and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) through an expert panel. The sensitivity analysis ensures the robustness of mathematical parameters and future variations in the market; on the other hand, the AHP validates the Artificial Intelligence (AI) results with interactions of human factors. Further developments should also consider the manufacturing and use phases in the optimization model.

AB This empirical study aims to construct and evaluate an eco-design learning framework to help instructors design practical teaching in engineering curricula and enhance the sustainability competency of engineering undergraduates. The framework was designed into three phases, including introductory lecture, life cycle assessment (LCA) practice, and eco-design embedding. The formative reflection on the previous phase was analyzed to provide suggestions for the next phase of teaching settings, thereby forming an iterative mechanism. A structured design flowchart, technical documents, and LCA toolkit were provided as scaffolding for students to implement eco-design. The immediate feedback learning environment helped students overcome challenges in the eco-design practice. The experimental findings suggested that the participants had good learning initiative in the learning process, and the deep learning needs were synchronized with the three-phase curriculum. The curriculum improved participants' sustainability competency in terms of environmental consciousness and eco-design skills. Participants' overall reflection on the curriculum showed that the improvements were related to the teaching materials, curriculum settings, and learning environment involved in the eco-design learning framework. Also, the limitations and future research directions were discussed.

AB Life Cycle Assessment is necessary for evaluating the environmental impacts of buildings throughout their life cycle, considering factors such as energy consumption, emissions, and resource utilization. However, Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment introduces a temporal dimension, acknowledging that a building's environmental performance evolves due to technological advancements, occupancy behavior, and changing environmental conditions. This paper reviews DLCA, focusing on uncertainties arising from parameter, scenario, and model variability, and emphasizes the integration of technologies like Building Information Modeling, the Internet of Things, and machine learning to enhance real-time data collection and predictive analytics. An extensive review of 430 papers, refined to 180, reveals that 55 % of publications are in environmental sciences, with significant contributions from the United Kingdom (27.8 %), France (24.1 %), and China (18.1 %). Key findings include significant variations in embodied greenhouse gas emissions for materials like aluminum and the dynamic aspects of transportation impacts, which extend beyond traditional metrics to include operational efficiency over time. Uncertainties in all LCA stages (A1 to D) are addressed, focusing on service life, operational energy and water use, and transportation needs. Advanced methodologies, including a proposed framework for a hybrid LCA approach that integrates process-based and input-output methods, are suggested to enhance the comprehensiveness of assessments. The integration of real-time monitoring and predictive analytics further improves the adaptability and precision of LCA models, emphasizing the necessity of continuous updates and scenario analyses to capture future conditions accurately. This study paves the way for future research aimed at mitigating major sources of uncertainty, promoting more sustainable building practices, and advancing the field of dynamic LCA.

AB This study introduces a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG)-based framework designed to support sustainable decision-making by integrating, enriching, and analyzing heterogeneous data sources. The proposed methodology leverages domain expertise, real-world data, and synthetic data generated through language models to address challenges in life cycle assessment (LCA), particularly data scarcity and inconsistency. By modeling the entire product lifecycle, including engineering, production, usage, and disposal phases, the framework facilitates early-stage design decision-making and provides actionable insights for sustainability improvements. The methodology is validated through a case study on 3D printing (3DP), demonstrating its ability to manage complex data, highlight relationships between engineering decisions and environmental impacts, and mitigate data scarcity in the early phases of product development in the context of LCAs. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the framework's potential to drive sustainable innovation in manufacturing.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies are frequently used to evaluate the environmental burdens of pavement facilities. This information can be used by decision-makers to advise their construction and maintenance policies. Within the pavement life cycle, there are a variety of uncertainties, such as future traffic growth and pavement deterioration. Currently, there is a lack of research examining the use of LCA models that can simultaneously optimize construction and maintenance plans while accounting for several sources of uncertainty. This study presents an approach to LCA modeling that implements a sub-type of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms called Q-learning. Q-learning offers a model-free approach that can efficiently manage stochastic problems of parametric and non-parametric form. The algorithm iteratively learns a set of near-optimal decision rules to proactively manage pavement assets for a diverse range of possible future scenarios. These decision-rules are stored in a convenient look-up table, which will appeal to practitioners for its ease of use in probabilistic LCA studies. This paper subsequently tests the performance of the Q-learning approach across three representative case studies with varying traffic volumes: a local street-highway, a state highway, and an interstate. The case study results show that, on average, the proposed algorithm reduces the expected global warming impact of pavement infrastructure between 13% and 18% over a 50-year analysis period. Based on our results, Q-learning is a promising approach that can help decision-makers account for several sources of uncertainty and implement improved management strategies to mitigate the environmental impacts of their products and systems.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) as a decision support tool for evaluating the environmental load of products has been widely used in many fields. However, applying LCA in the building industry is expensive and time consuming. This is due to the complexity of building structure along with a large amount of high-dimensional heterogeneous building data. So far building environmental impact assessment (BEIA) is an important yet under-addressed issue. This paper gives a brief survey of BEIA and investigates potential advantages of using data mining techniques to discover the relationships between building materials and environment impacts. We formulate three important BEIA issues as a series of data mining problems, and propose corresponding solution schemes. Specifically, first, a feature selection approach is proposed based on the practical demand and construction characteristics to perform assessment analysis. Second, a unified framework for solving constraint-based clustering ensemble selection is proposed to extend the environmental impact assessment range from the building level to the regional level. Finally, a multiple disparate clustering method is presented to help sustainable new buildings design. We expect our proposal would shed light on data-driven approaches for environment impact assessment.

AB With growing sustainability and environmental concerns regarding the products, decision-makers and business managers need to integrate sustainability into business strategies and support it via systematic business processes and decision support tools. With the integration of the eco-efficiency attributes to the product development, more data should be analysed in engineering design. This integration also increases the complexity of the design process due to the large volume of data processing and diversity of the different attributes and features of the products. In this paper, we used the stock market metaphor to develop a visual data mining approach to the strategic eco-design assessment of the complex products. We presented a fresh framework using clustering and visualisation techniques to analyse the eco-efficiency profile of the different modules, components and parts of a complex product, and provide an efficient data exploration tool for decision-makers to facilitate processing of eco-design attributes, and strategic objectives at the same time. An illustrative example is provided to show the procedure of the application and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Electronic waste is one of the world's rapidly increasing environmental issues because a wide range of toxic substances are not closely monitored that can pollute the atmosphere and affect health. This paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence Technique (AIT) for the analysis of hazardous pollutants in e-waste and their effects on the climate and human health and management policies in certain countries. Artificial Intelligence Techniques (AIT) are being developed for managing e-waste, especially based on prevailing strategies such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). In the e-waste management sector, eco-design systems must be created, e-waste properly processed, recycled, and reused content through safe methods, e-waste disposed of using appropriate techniques, used electronic devices cannot be transferred to developing countries, and the burden of e-waste should be increased. Artificial intelligence-based MCA and EPR is a reasonable approach to address the increasing problems with e-wastes.

AB The utilization of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and its corresponding methodologies gained considerable attention within the realm of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability assessment. Nevertheless, a lack of extensive investigation on their integration along with quantitative procedures, for example, statistical techniques and artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged. The purpose of this literature review is to investigate the extent to which these methodologies have been connected so far in order to achieve objectives concerning the assessment of sustainability. The scope of the study was restricted to articles published in peer-reviewed journals throughout the period from 1960 to 2022. The investigation was conducted by using a broad set of keywords, encompassing both life cycle methods, including Life Cycle Assessment, Environmental Life Cycle Costing and Emergy Accounting, and quantitative methods, such as mathematical methods, economic methods and building information modeling methods. A total of 144 articles addressing the combined use of life cycle methods and quantitative methodologies for the evaluation of sustainability were identified in the literature review. The greater part of these studies relied on the combined use of LCA with mathematical models, statistical methods and AI methods. As a result, the studies proven that the joint application of such methods can improve consistency of sustainability assessment and enhance CSR. Additionally, many articles suggested novel approaches, including a combined use of LCA and building information modeling as well as simulation methods. The combined use of life cycle methods alongside quantitative methods offers promise in enhancing sustainability assessment by offering more precise and consistent outcomes. However, it becomes imperative to carefully evaluate the hypotheses, accuracy of data, and uncertainty associated with each method within the integration process. Additional research needs to be conducted in order to establish standardized protocols for combining these methodologies as well as to identify the most suitable procedures for their integration with respect to specific objectives concerning sustainability assessment.

AB This paper presents the outlines of a research project that aims to develop a semantic-based framework for delivering near real-time environmental footprint and informing effective operation and management strategies for the built environment. This paper argues that a semantic life cycle approach leveraging the value of real-time data can facilitate and enhance the accuracy of dynamic life cycle assessments. The methodology involves three distinct elements, namely semantics, dynamic data, and learning systems. Several use cases will be explored to validate the proposed methodology on real case studies. Following a review of related work, the methodology will be presented to explain the various components involved and the information exchange between different layers. The planned use case will be briefly introduced, followed by conclusion and future work.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a promising technology for recovering value-added resources from organic waste, thus achieving sustainable waste management. The performance of AD is dictated by a variety of factors including system design and operating conditions. This necessitates developing suitable modelling and optimi-zation tools to quantify its off-design performance, where the application of machine learning (ML) and soft computing approaches have received increasing attention. Here, we succinctly reviewed the latest progress in black-box ML approaches for AD modelling with a thrust on global and local model interpretability metrics (e.g., Shapley values, partial dependence analysis, permutation feature importance). Categorical applications of the ML and soft computing approaches such as what-if scenario analysis, fault detection in AD systems, long-term operation prediction, and integration of ML with life cycle assessment are discussed. Finally, the research gaps and scopes for future work are summarized.

AB Artificial spiking neurons are one of the building blocks of neuromorphic systems. Such type of hardware is often promised to offer energy-efficient platforms to run Deep Learning algorithms on large datasets. These systems require large numbers of neuronal primitives, raising the question of the environmental footprint of their fabrication. In this work, we propose to address this matter by performing a cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of an artificial neuron based on Vanadium Dioxide, fabricated in a lab-scale fab. We focus on the Cumulated Energy Demand (CED), Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Ultra Pure Water consumption (UPW) metrics. We identify the use of gold for the electrical contacts (the dominant practice in the fabrication of such devices) as the critical step, representing respectively 38 % and 49 % of the total CED and GWP associated to the device fabrication. We further explore the validity of this result by varying key parameters in different scenarios. In an eco-design approach, we propose the replacement of gold by aluminium as a way to curb the total process CED and GWP by respectively 25% and 43 %, and show first evidence that the device electrical properties are preserved in this case. Finally, we provide a first attempt at comparing the direct environmental footprint and performance of VO2 neuron with CMOS-based implementations.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate excessive carbon emissions in sustainable building projects. Although there are numerous applications of AI, there is no state-of-the-art review of how AI applications can reduce net-zero carbon emissions (NZCEs) for sustainable building projects. Therefore, this review study aims to conduct a systematic literature and science mapping review of AI applications in NZCEs for sustainable building projects, thereby expediting the realization of NZCEs in building projects. A mixed-method approach (i.e., systematic literature review and science mapping) consisting of four comprehensive stages was used to retrieve relevant published articles from the Scopus database. A total of 154 published articles were retrieved and used to conduct science mapping analyses and qualitative discussions, including mainstream research topics, gaps, and future research directions. Six mainstream research topics were identified and discussed. These include (1) life cycle assessment and carbon footprint, (2) practical applications of AI technology, (3) multi-objective optimization, (4) energy management and energy efficiency, (5) carbon emissions from buildings, and (6) decision support systems and sustainability. In addition, this review suggests six research gaps and develops a framework depicting future research directions. The findings contribute to advancing AI applications in reducing carbon emissions in sustainable building projects and can help researchers and practitioners to realize its economic and environmental benefits.

AB Accurate International Roughness Index (IRI) deterioration patterns are key to quantifying carbon emissions (CEs) in the use and maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) phases of pavement life cycle assessment (LCA). Despite evidence that initial IRI has a significant impact on IRI deterioration, most LCA studies still used an ideal fixed value for initial IRI. Therefore, enhancing initial IRI data quality is essential for improving LCA model. To develop an initial IRI prediction model, a dataset containing data on surface layer material, pavement structure, and construction conditions was collected from the Shanxi Department of Transportation. The best of four machine learning models used in this study has been able to achieve an excellent performance (R2 = 0.831). Factors such as compaction number and mixture ratio significantly affect initial IRI. Based on three real cases, the integration of best initial IRI prediction model with LCA and heuristic optimisation algorithm was used to obtain mixture ratios corresponding to the optimal life cycle CEs. For three cases, the total CEs of the optimized results were reduced by 22.7 % (314,942 Kg CO2-eq), 16.7 % (242,565 Kg CO2-eq) and 17.1 % (251,931 Kg CO2-eq) compared to the real results, with the use and M&R phases contributing over 90 % of the total reduction. This illustrates the need to consider the impact of materials on the use and M&R phases when evaluating material benefits using pavement LCA. These processes can also build a framework for designing surface layer mixture to minimize CEs, which can provide a reference for other material production.

AB Calculating emissions and related environmental impacts for buildings is typically a data-heavy and labour-intensive task. Widely used life cycle assessment (LCA) standards require meticulous modelling of multiple processes for each part within a product or a subassembly. This level of detailing demands time-consuming manual modelling and essentially renders full LCA of entire city blocks unrealistic. Within this context, this paper investigates how LCA results of modelling processes which involve a range of automated input data sources compare to those resulting from a highly detailed base case model. Findings show that models generated from data gathered from Google Street View and the U.S. Census produce the closest results to the base case model, with the lowest deviations occurring in embodied energy (0.06-6.0%) and global warming potential (0.7-4.8%) results. These findings imply that data with lower granularity can lead to precise LCA results, depending on the inventory and impact categories considered.

AB This study developed a pilot-scale process feeding with two different materials resulting from a column leaching process and acid mine drainage (AMD) streams to recover rare earth elements (REEs). A life cycle assessment (LCA) study was done to evaluate the environmental impacts of rare earth production from deleterious material in the form of highly contaminated leachate (HCL) and low-contaminated leachate (LCL). The results indicate that the main contributors to environmental categories that produce RE-hydroxide stages are NaOH and electricity. Also, oxalic acid, Na2CO3, and hydrochloric acid significantly contribute to the production stage of individual rare earth oxides (REOs), including solvent extraction (SX) and precipitation steps. The HCL route has higher environmental impacts than LCL due to higher chemical/energy and H2SO4 usage, so 468 and 292 kg of carbon dioxide are generated to produce 1 t of individual REOs from HCL and LCL routes, respectively. Moreover, the carbon dioxide emitted from the process, including the RE-hydroxide production, SX, and REOs production, is less than 10 t CO2. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the changeability of the environmental footprints of the main inputs in the SX process, as the main stage has a higher contribution to the whole process. This LCA study is the first step toward understanding the environmental influence of new processing methods to produce REEs from coal by-products through a developed pilot-scale process.

AB This study proposes methods to improve data mining workflows for modeling chemical manufacturing life cycle inventory. Secondary data sources can provide valuable information about environmental releases during chemical manufacturing. However, the often facility-level nature of the data challenges their utility for modeling specific processes and can impact the quality of the resulting inventory. First, a thorough data source analysis is performed to establish data quality scoring and create filtering rules to resolve data selection issues when source and species overlaps arise. A method is then introduced to develop context-based filter rules that leverage process metadata within data sources to improve how facility air releases are attributed to specific processes and increase the technological correlation and completeness of the inventory. Finally, a sanitization method is demonstrated to improve data quality by minimizing the exclusion of confidential business information (CBI). The viability of the methods is explored using case studies of cumene and sodium hydroxide production in the United States. The attribution of air releases using process context enables more sophisticated filtering to remove unnecessary flows from the inventory. The ability to sanitize and incorporate CBI is promising because it increases the sample size, and therefore representativeness, when constructing geographically averaged inventories. Future work will focus on expanding the application of context-based data filtering to other types and sources of environmental data.

AB In the last few decades, sustainability has become one of the main challenges of beauty companies driven by growing consumer demand for more natural-based cosmetics. Fragrances playing a major role in cosmetic formula, they have to be taken into account in the eco-design process of cosmetics. The composition of fragrances can imply up to one hundred different fragrance ingredients, but is most of the time kept secret to protect the professional knowledge of fragance's suppliers. Different eco-design tools exist, based for example on green chemistry principles and metrics. These tools may address various environmental impacts or life-cycle steps, from the single E-factor indicator, which focuses on the amount of waste per amount of product at the production step, to an elaborated set of indicators, like in the GREEN MOTION & TRADE; tool developed by MANE. On the other hand, to assess the holistic environmental impacts of products over their whole life-cycle, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is the most recognized method. However, it requires extensive amounts of data which can be difficult to obtain or inaccessible for various reasons, including confidentiality. To compare these different possible approaches of fragances eco-design, the results of an LCA of 27 selected fragrance ingredients are compared to those obtained with the green chemistry tool GREEN MOTION & TRADE;. Fragrance ingredients were found to have a wide range of environmental impacts, depending on their production process and on the starting raw material used. Overall, tendencies observed on results with the 2 tools are in good accordance. This study therefore showcases the complementarity of simplified eco-design tools and metrics with LCA to address environmental impacts of fragrance ingredients. Indeed, the former can be used as a first approach to identify environmental hotspots and implement eco-design practices in the development process of fragrance ingredients, while the latter highlights potential direct and indirect impacts over the upstream life cycle and the ingredient production itself, and can be used to measure the reduction of the global environmental footprint achieved through the implementation of eco-design practices. Based on these results on fragrance ingredients, a clustering method could be developed to help conduct LCA of fragrances.

AB Purpose Global sensitivity analysis increasingly replaces manual sensitivity analysis in life cycle assessment (LCA). Variance-based global sensitivity analysis identifies influential uncertain model input parameters by estimating so-called Sobol indices that represent each parameter's contribution to the variance in model output. However, this technique can potentially be unreliable when analyzing non-normal model outputs, and it does not inform analysts about specific values of the model input or output that may be decision-relevant. We demonstrate three emerging methods that build on variance-based global sensitivity analysis and that can provide new insights on uncertainty in typical LCA applications that present non-normal output distributions, trade-offs between environmental impacts, and interactions between model inputs. Methods To identify influential model inputs, trade-offs, and decision-relevant interactions, we implement techniques for distribution-based global sensitivity analysis (PAWN technique), spectral clustering, and scenario discovery (patient rule induction method: PRIM). We choose these techniques because they are applicable with generic Monte Carlo sampling and common LCA software. We compare these techniques with variance-based Sobol indices, using a previously published LCA case study of geothermal heating networks. We assess eight environmental impacts under uncertainty for three design alternatives, spanning different geothermal production temperatures and heating network configurations. Results In the application case on geothermal heating networks, PAWN distribution-based sensitivity indices generally identify influential model parameters consistently with Sobol indices. However, some discrepancies highlight the potentially misleading interpretation of Sobol indices on the non-normal distributions obtained in our analysis, where variance may not meaningfully describe uncertainty. Spectral clustering highlights groups of model results that present different trade-offs between environmental impacts. Compared to second-order Sobol interaction indices, PRIM then provides more precise information regarding the combinations of input values associated with these different groups of calculated impacts. PAWN indices, spectral clustering, and PRIM have a computational advantage because they yield stable results at relatively small sample sizes (n = 12,000), unlike Sobol indices (n = 100,000 for second-order indices). Conclusions We recommend adding these new techniques to global sensitivity analysis in LCA as they give more precise as well as additional insights on uncertainty regardless of the distribution of the model outputs. PAWN distribution-based global sensitivity analysis provides a computationally efficient assessment of input sensitivities as compared to variance-based global sensitivity analysis. The combination of clustering and scenario discovery enables analysts to precisely identify combinations of input parameters or uncertainties associated with different outcomes of environmental impacts.

AB Purpose Objective uncertainty quantification (UQ) of a product life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a critical step for decision-making. Environmental impacts can be measured directly or by using models. Underlying mathematical functions describe a model that approximate the environmental impacts during various LCA stages. In this study, three possible uncertainty sources of a mathematical model, i.e., input variability, model parameter (differentiate from input in this study), and model-form uncertainties, were investigated. A simple and easy to implement method is proposed to quantify each source.
   Methods Various data analytics methods were used to conduct a thorough model uncertainty analysis; (1) Interval analysis was used for input uncertainty quantification. A direct sampling using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was used for interval analysis, and results were compared to that of indirect nonlinear optimization as an alternative approach. A machine learning surrogate model was developed to perform direct MC sampling as well as indirect nonlinear optimization. (2) A Bayesian inference was adopted to quantify parameter uncertainty. (3) A recently introduced model correction method based on orthogonal polynomial basis functions was used to evaluate the model-form uncertainty. The methods are applied to a pavement LCA to propagate uncertainties throughout an energy and global warming potential (GWP) estimation model; a case of a pavement section in Chicago metropolitan area was used.
   Results and discussion Results indicate that each uncertainty source contributes to the overall energy and GWP output of the LCA. Input uncertainty was shown to have significant impact on overall GWP output; for the example case study, GWP interval was around 50%. Parameter uncertainty results showed that an assumption of +/- 10% uniform variation in the model parameter priors resulted in 28% variation in the GWP output. Model-form uncertainty had the lowest impact (less than 10% variation in the GWP). This is because the original energy model is relatively accurate in estimating the energy. However, sensitivity of the model-form uncertainty showed that even up to 180% variation in the results can be achieved due to lower original model accuracies.
   Conclusions Investigating each uncertainty source of the model indicated the importance of the accurate characterization, propagation, and quantification of uncertainty. The outcome of this study proposed independent and relatively easy to implement methods that provide robust grounds for objective model uncertainty analysis for LCA applications. Assumptions on inputs, parameter distributions, and model form need to be justified. Input uncertainty plays a key role in overall pavement LCA output. The proposed model correction method as well as interval analysis were relatively easy to implement. Research is still needed to develop a more generic and simplified MCMC simulation procedure that is fast to implement.

AB Purpose In response to the increasing concerns on the environmental conservation and energy saving, manufacturers are more aware of proving the 'green' performance of their products. Some qualitative eco design tools are used to support the development of greener products; however, most of these tools require subjective judgement during the evaluation processes. This paper is therefore to propose an alternative approach that is objective, systematic and efficient, by integrating the ant colony optimization (ACO) and life cycle assessment (LCA), to facilitate the decision-making process. Methods The proposed integrative LCA-ACO approach aims to support the simultaneous thorough evaluations of multiple design options. A sequence of options of the lowest corresponding environmental impact value can be obtained. A case application example of various design combinations is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Results and discussion The proposed approach offers decision makers a preliminary fast-track approach for screening decisions without lengthy processes of LCA studies. This approach helps the decision makers, especially during the early design selection stages, identifying the most appropriate design combination from the environmental perspective. The proposed approach is proved a significant contribution to the field of LCA and green product design. Conclusions Since full-scale LCA studies require significant effort in data collection processes and experts for result interpretations, it would be time consuming and costly to conduct a full-scale LCA during early product development processes. The proposed approach offers a more convenient way for decision makers to assess multiple design options regarding the environmental considerations. The case example presented in this paper proves the practicality of the proposed approach.

AB This research paper presents a data-driven framework for design optimization of renewable energy communities (RECs) in the residential sector, considering both techno-economic challenges and environmental impact. The study's focus is to determine suitable sizes for photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and battery electrical energy systems by evaluating energy, economic, and environmental criteria. To achieve this, we develop a data-driven model that incorporates Homer Pro and an in-house tool developed in Python programming language that integrates a machine learning algorithm, life cycle cost (LCC), life cycle assessment (LCA) calculations of the REC model. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization model is established to minimize the LCC and LCA parameters while maximizing green energy use. Moreover, a multi-criteria decision-making approach based on Weighted Sum Model (WSM) is proposed to help the stakeholders to see beyond the selection criteria based on LCC and LCA to choose the most appropriate scenario optimal solution for the desired energy community and interpret the effect of various economic parameters on the sustainable performance of REC. The framework application is illustrated through a case study for the optimal design of REC for a residential community in Tarragona, Spain, consisting of 100 buildings. The results revealed a substantial improvement in economic , environmental benefits for designing REC, the optimal minimum cost solution with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE = 0.044 $/kWh) and a payback period of 7.1 years with an LCOE reduction of 85.04% compared to the base case. The minimum impact with an LCOE = 0.220 $/kWh and a payback period of 12.5 years with a reduction in environmental impact of 54.59% compared to the base case. Overall, the developed data -driven provides policy decision -making with an evaluation of REC in the residential sector.

AB Global warming and the depletion of petroleum resources require immediate and focused attention, and there is a pressing need to accelerate progress. Digital approaches can be leveraged in these efforts, for example in exploring effective replacements for petrochemicals or effectively identifying molecules with better performance. One such potential replacement is lignocellulosic biomass: a sustainable feedstock for producing chemicals and fuels that does not compete with essential food supply. However, the inherent complexity of lignocellulosic biomass and the technical challenges in its transformation pose significant obstacles that require data-driven approaches to solve. Here, we use the catalytic transformation of lignocellulose to value added chemicals as a case study highlighting the critical role of digital technologies, including improved data integration, process optimization, and system-level decision-making in catalyst design, synthesis, and characterization. Data-driven approaches work hand-in-hand with technology: the integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) allows for efficient molecule design and optimization; coupling ML/AI with the use of flow chemistry and high-throughput synthesis techniques enhances scalability and sustainability. Together, these innovations can facilitate a more resilient and sustainable chemical industry, reducing dependency on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental impact.

AB Recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) plays a significant role in the circular economy and sustainable development of the construction industry by effectively reducing raw material consumption, promoting resource efficiency, and facilitating the low-carbon transition of the sector. Based on 1255 RAC mix design data collected from published literature and laboratory experiments, this study employs machine learning methods to develop an intelligent prediction model for RAC compressive strength and designs an intelligent mix proportioning model to meet target compressive strengths, resulting in a dataset containing millions of mix designs across various compressive strength grades. The Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC) method is used to analyze the relationships between RAC compressive strength and various influencing factors. Additionally, a carbon emission calculation model for RAC is constructed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method, and carbon emissions across different strength grades of RAC are analyzed. Sustainable design target values for RAC are established, considering the critical transportation distance of recycled aggregates. The study further explores the potential of emerging road transport technologies to enhance the application of recycled aggregates. The results indicate that recycled aggregate (RA) and the water-to-cement ratio are the most critical factors affecting RAC compressive strength. RAC mix design optimization demonstrates significant potential for carbon emission reduction, particularly with a notable impact from the transportation phase. Emerging road transport technologies could facilitate the broader use of RA, especially in low-strength concrete, to maximize resource recycling and reduce carbon emissions. The findings provide both theoretical and practical support for the recycling and application of RA in concrete.

AB The ability to conduct life cycle analyses of complex structures is vitally important for environmental and social considerations. Incorporating the life cycle into structural design optimization results in extended com-putational durations, underscoring the need for an innovative solution. This paper introduces a methodology leveraging deep learning to hasten structural constraint computations in an optimization context, considering the structure's life cycle. Using a composite bridge composed of concrete and steel as a case study, the research delves into hyperparameter fine-tuning to craft a robust model that accelerates calculations. The optimal deep learning model is then integrated with three metaheuristics: the Old Bachelor Acceptance with a Mutation Operator (OBAMO), the Cuckoo Search (CS), and the Sine Cosine Algorithms (SCA). Results indicate a potential 50-fold increase in computational speed using the deep learning model in certain scenarios. A comprehensive comparison reveals economic feasibility, environmental ramifications, and social life cycle assessments, with an augmented steel yield strength observed in optimal design solutions for both environmental and social objective functions, highlighting the benefits of meshing deep learning with civil engineering design optimization.

AB This study examines the domestic solid waste management system in the LATAM region, using the city of Guayaquil in Ecuador as a case study. Through the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, the study compares domestic and external recycling processes, evaluating their effects on global warming potential, fossil resource scarcity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. The results reveal that increasing recycling rates significantly reduces environmental impacts, with domestic recycling offering slightly higher environmental benefits than external options. A demographic analysis using machine learning techniques identifies distinct patterns of waste generation across different population clusters, highlighting the need for tailored waste management strategies. The study also emphasizes the importance of accurate local data and the integration of recycling initiatives with market realities, particularly in the light of policies mandating recycled content in products like PET bottles. A sensitivity analysis of the waste recovery indicator (WRI) demonstrates the potential for substantial environmental and economic benefits with higher recycling rates. The findings suggest that, to advance towards a circular economy, Latin American cities like Guayaquil must enhance their recycling infrastructure, refine waste management policies, and focus on demographic-specific strategies. This research contributes to the broader understanding of sustainable waste management in developing regions, offering insights for future policy and infrastructure development.

AB Designers need to be aware early in the design phase of the environmental impact of their choices over the entire product life cycle. This paper proposes an eco-design method to support designers of different categories of electric vehicles, such as self-driving vehicles, cars, shuttles and buses. The methodology developed aims to realize a model for predicting the environmental impact of industrial electric vehicles. The proposed approach exploits machine learning methods to develop models with the design features of a generic electric vehicle, such as vehicle mass and distance traveled during its entire lifetime as independent parameters, to estimate the emissions of new products. The environmental impact indicator for this study is Climate Change, the dependent parameter chosen for the impact model. Machine learning algorithms were trained on training data retrieved from an automatic environmental impact estimation software tool based on an analytical approach. All stages of the product life cycle have been considered in the construction of the database, and the model provides quantitative results that consider the consumption of material and energy resources. Finally, the model is tested by estimating the environmental impact of a tourist shuttle.

AB Monitoring the transition to a circular economy requires not only the measurement of circularity but also of environmental impacts, which often present trade-offs due to different perspectives when assessing a product. This article proposes a novel approach, named ECI-MCDA, to combine circularity and Life -Cycle Assessment (LCA) indicators via Multi -Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) non -compensatory methods (Electre I and Electre TRI). The proposed approach includes a clustering analysis to inform the choice of circularity indicators, and a robustness analysis to assess the influence of the MCDA parameters. The ECI-MCDA approach is applied to a multifunctional building sandwich -block (CleanTechBlock) composed of a thermal insulation layer incorporating over 90% recycled glass. The environmental performance and circularity of CleanTechBlock is assessed for different end -of -life (EoL) scenarios, including reuse, closed- and open -loop recycling. The ECI-MCDA approach has demonstrated its efficacy in handling divergent results between circularity and environmental performance, identifying an alternative that addresses both perspectives. Additionally, the proposed approach shows the potential to support decision -making to improve circularity and environmental performance, thereby promoting the eco-design of products.

AB Mix design optimization is challenging because the properties of concrete depend on both the chemical and physical properties of the components and their relative proportions. In this paper a mix design optimization approach based on the application of artificial intelligence, genetic algorithm optimisation, life-cycle assessment to quantify global warming potential (GWP) and simple economic modeling is developed and applied to identify the optimal use of fly ash and granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) in concretes with blended binders. A database including 892 mixes with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) is used to predict the concrete compressive strength and slump. Five case studies are presented investigating the influence of: chemical makeup of cement and SCMs, minimum cement content, regional transportation, emissions allocation, and binder type on the GWP and cost of optimal mix designs. The results show that the tool developed can reduce GWP by up to 60% and cost by up to 40% when compared to experimental results with equivalent strength.

AB In this paper, a joint environmental and economic analysis of different Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) control strategies is carried out. The assessment is based on the application of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a method to evaluate the environmental impact and the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1). The BSM1 is taken as the benchmark scenario used to implement the control strategies. The Effluent Quality Index (EQI) and the Overall Cost Index (OCI) are two indicators provided by BSM1 and used to evaluate the plant's performance from the effluent quality and the economic points of view, respectively. This work conducts a combined analysis and assessment of ten different control strategies defined to operate a wastewater treatment plant. This analysis includes the usual economic and performance indexes provided by BSM1 joined with the LCA analysis that determines the environmental impact linked to each one of the considered control strategies. It is shown how to get an overall evaluation of the environmental effects by using a normalized graphical representation that can be easily used to compare control strategies from the environmental impact point of view. The use of only the BSM1 indexes provides an assessment that leads to a clustering of control strategies according to the cost/quality tradeoff they show. Therefore, regarding the cost/quality tradeoff, all strategies in the same group are almost equal and do not provide an indication on how to proceed in order to select the appropriate one. It is therefore shown how the fact of adding a new, complementary, evaluation (LCA based) allows either to reinforce a decision that could be taken solely on the basis of the EQI/OCI tradeoff or to select one control strategy among the others.

AB The design of residential foundation slabs is commonly based on standards that emphasise the structural aspects and safety of the structure. Factors related to environmental and economic criteria are seldom given due consideration in the design phase. Considering the growing demand for sustainable approaches driven mainly by climate change concerns, this study developed a smart tool called Multi-OUtput Non-linear Design of Slabs (MOUNDS), which simultaneously predicts embodied energy, carbon emission, life cycle cost and deflection of waffle and stiffened rafts. MOUNDS considers the environmental, economic, and serviceability criteria of waffle and stiffened rafts on soils having varying reactivities. The standard deemed-to-comply design code for residential slabs and footings in Australia was investigated to determine the most advantageous foundation type in terms of both sustainability attributes and serviceability performances. The developed MOUNDS algorithm has shown accurate predictions. The predicted values of the: embodied energy of the residential slabs, greenhouse gas emission of the residential slabs, life cycle cost of the residential slabs, and maximum deflection of the residential slabs of waffle rafts were found more sustainable and serviceable than stiffened rafts in slight to moderate reactive sites. When sites are highly reactive, the difference between the environmental and economic of waffle rafts and stiffened rafts was minimal and did not conform to the serviceability limits of the Australian design code. This novel study linked and predicted the multi-disciplinary relationship between the environmental, economic and structural design aspects of residential slabs through machine learning. This is valuable in decision-making throughout the design phase considering the multi-faceted aspects of residential footing systems on reactive soils.

AB Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) are widely considered as an emerging technology that shows capability for enabling environmentally friendly large-scale production of hydrogen. PCEC stacks' performance is considerably lower compared to smaller, lab-scale button cells. This performance gap is largely attributed to the highly uneven distribution of reactants throughout the larger cell or stack, which presents a significant challenge to the development of PCEC stack. The issue of non-uniform reactant distribution in PCEC stacks can be effectively addressed by incorporating metal foam structures to replace the conventional rib design of the interconnect components. A 3D multiphysical model is developed to train a deep-learning-boosted surrogate model for PCEC with metal foam, which is subsequently used for parameter screening and sensitivity analysis. A collection of 12 inputs that encompass operating/structural/microstructural/material parameters are chosen, in which the operating parameters are identified as influential parameters. Three distribution uniformity indices maintain strong consistence to variations in the inputs, implying the positive role of metal foam. Faradaic efficiency (FE) is primarily influenced by the operating voltage with a total Sobol index of 0.6. The current density and FE are determined as the most stable performance indicators, exhibiting standard deviations of 0.15 and 0.81 respectively. According to a safety threshold of 10 K cm(-1) for temperature gradient, the probability of the stack operating below this threshold is 88.61 %. Valuable insights into the design and performance of PCEC stacks that incorporate metal foam structures are provided. The workflow developed in this work can be further leveraged to explore and optimize PCECs.

AB Construction materials play an important role in environmental impacts and make cities big resource consumers. To assess the sustainability of cities, the combined use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Material Flow Analysis (MFA) is considered effective to analyze construction material stock and flows. However, exhaustive data is required for such analyses, making LCA and MFA difficult to apply at the urban scale. Building information, the essential ingredient, is rarely available openly. Common approaches to gather the required data include both obtaining it directly from available datasets, e.g. open data from official sources, and indirectly generating data based on available data, e.g. using machine learning to fill the missing gaps. This research develops a data collection guideline for buildings' geometrical features, components and materials at the urban scale in the context of LCA and MFA. First, it identifies the basic steps of urban-scale building stock modelling and the list of data requirements. Second, the factors influencing the data collection are pointed out. In line with these guidelines, this research picks Singapore as a study area, reviewing the relevant authoritative open data sources and methodologies to estimate missing data. Finally, the suggestion on implementation of data collection are provided. When the data collection for urban scale stock modelling is limited by uncertain reality conditions, identifying and combining open datasets and data generation methods for data preparation is a necessity.

AB Objective: Little is known about the effects of using different expert-determined reference standards when evaluating the performance of deep learning-based automatic detection (DLAD) models and their added value to radiologists. We assessed the concordance of expert-determined standards with a clinical gold standard (herein, pathological confirmation) and the effects of different expert-determined reference standards on the estimates of radiologists' diagnostic performance to detect malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs with and without the assistance of a DLAD model.
   Materials and Methods: This study included chest radiographs from 50 patients with pathologically proven lung cancer and 50 controls. Five expert-determined standards were constructed using the interpretations of 10 experts: individual judgment by the most experienced expert, majority vote, consensus judgments of two and three experts, and a latent class analysis (LCA) model. In separate reader tests, additional 10 radiologists independently interpreted the radiographs and then assisted with the DLAD model. Their diagnostic performance was estimated using the clinical gold standard and various expertdetermined standards as the reference standard, and the results were compared using the t test with Bonferroni correction.
   Results: The LCA model (sensitivity, 72.6%; specificity, 100%) was most similar to the clinical gold standard. When expertdetermined standards were used, the sensitivities of radiologists and DLAD model alone were overestimated, and their specificities were underestimated (all p-values < 0.05). DLAD assistance diminished the overestimation of sensitivity but exaggerated the underestimation of specificity (all p-values < 0.001). The DLAD model improved sensitivity and specificity to a greater extent when using the clinical gold standard than when using the expert-determined standards (all p-values < 0.001), except for sensitivity with the LCA model (p = 0.094).
   Conclusion: The LCA model was most similar to the clinical gold standard for malignant pulmonary nodule detection on chest radiographs. Expert-determined standards caused bias in measuring the diagnostic performance of the artificial intelligence model.

AB The optimization of energy, environmental and economic (3E) outcomes is the principal approach to identifying retrofit solutions for a sustainable built environment. By applying this approach and defining a set energy performance target, this study proposes a makeshift decision framework that integrates a data mining procedure (agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC)) into the decision-making process to provide a simplified 3E assessment of building retrofits on a macro-scale. The framework comprises of three model layers: (1) a building stock aggregation model, (2) an individualistic 3E model that provides the sensitivity analysis for (3) a life cycle cost-environmental assessment model. The framework is demonstrated and validated with a case study aimed at achieving the set energy targets for low-rise office buildings (LOB) in Shanghai. The model defines 4 prototypical buildings for the existing LOB blocks, which are used for the individual evaluation of 12 commonly applied retrofit measures. Subsequently, a simplified LCC-environmental assessment was performed to evaluate the 3E prospects of 2048 possible retrofit combinations. The results uniquely identify retrofit solutions to attain the set energy performance targets and optimal building performance. Furthermore, the decision criteria for different investment scenarios are discussed. Overall, this study provides building investors an innovative framework for a facile and holistic assessment of a broader range of retrofit alternatives based on set performance targets.

AB Various factors need to be considered in process design optimization to implement the complex processes of CO2 capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Here, bi-objective optimization of single-stage CO2 membrane separation was performed for two evaluation indexes: cost and CO2 emissions. During optimization, the process flow configuration was fixed, the membrane performance was set under the condition of the Robeson upper bound, and the membrane area and operating conditions were set as variables. Bi-objective optimization was performed using an original algorithm that combines the adaptive design of experiments, machine learning, a genetic algorithm, and Bayesian optimization. Five case studies with different product CO2 purities in the constraint were analyzed. Pareto solutions were superior for case studies with lower product CO2 purities. The set of Pareto solutions revealed opposite directions for optimization: either (1) increase the membrane area to reduce CO2 emissions but increase costs or (2) increase power consumption and reduce costs but increase CO2 emissions. The implemented bi-objective optimization approach is promising for evaluating the membrane CO2 capture process and the individual processes of CCUS.

AB Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production system, and the sector accounts for more than half of all fish consumed. Its potential as a sustainable food source has been recognised within the EU Farm to Fork strategy and by the targeting of EU Green Deal research funds. Aquafeed is the primary source of environmental cost in farmed finfish and shrimp life cycle assessments (LCA), and thus, emerging ingredients have a key role to play in increasing its sustainability. This paper proposes that the development and `design' of feed compositions can be disrupted by innovative approaches that simultaneously optimise-via multicriteria analysis-ingredient selection through leveraging economic, nutritional, life cycle cost and environmental datasets. This would be supported by the ongoing collection and curation of these same resources. Further, integration of these disparate resources can enable advanced ingredient traceability. The outcome of such an approach would greatly contribute to increasingly efficient aquafeed production. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The benefits of process optimization brought by multiple tools that appeared in shopfloors with the fourth industrial revolution are undiscussed; however, they need electricity to run and require critical materials. Additionally, the significant impact on sustainability that early design decisions can have over the entire lifecycle is well-recognized. The literature counts several environmental analyses of electric vehicles but narrows almost uniquely on passengers' cars. Currently, the literature should i) enwiden the range of analyzed products, ii) consider all stages of the product life cycle, iii) provide tools suitable for the early stage of design, able to return consistent results handling very little data. As electrification is concerned, in the literature there are approaches intended to assess the environmental impacts or focused on the design tool. The proposed approach, further applied to develop an eco-design tool, overcomes the existing literature by providing a tool i) able to handle few data, ii) that considers all the product lifecycle phases, and iii) allows designers to assess and compare alternative scenarios. A method is proposed, and a tool derived. Two applications concern an electric shuttle and an autonomous mobile robot; with the latter the gap of assessing the environmental impact of autonomous mobile robots is also filled. The obtained results are reasonably comparable with other existing works. Results are compared to a full LCA for the frame assembly and prove that i) the tool is reliable, and it more likely overestimates the impacts; ii) the design phase is subjected to high variability, and this affects the tool results. Future works may introduce additional types of batteries, deeper focus on the manufacturing phase; machine learning techniques may support future extension of the tool and create parametric models for conceptual and early design. The proposed method and tool can be extended to the economic sphere.

AB In current complex building designs, sustainability assessments are often performed after project completion, with limited impact on building performance which results in missed goals in terms of quality, cost, and time. We address this problem by proposing a hierarchical reference-based know-why model to answer the research question "what is a suitable decision support model to successfully integrate the sustainability requirements in the early design phase of buildings? ". The model presents a process that incorporates a life-cycle perspective and calculates design alternatives based on a defined reference and the DGNB building certification system. The results show that criteria synergies and trade-offs can be identified, leading to improved design by engineers and better building performance. Our findings pave the way for full integration of the model into building information modeling, combined with artificial intelligence. This can help manage the complexity of the sustainable design process on the path to carbon-neutral buildings.

AB Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and intelligent data analysis can help in reducing carbon and water footprints of rail infrastructure construction projects. The goal is to improve the railway construction processes with regard to their environmental impact, mainly in those aspects related to climate change such as carbon and water footprints.
   Based on a set of 27 indicators of every task in the construction process, a comprehensive compilation of basic information was performed, where the main project units and their sub-tasks were reviewed and analyzed.
   Afterwards, focus was on analyzing the transformation from environmental impact to carbon and water footprints, by means of the development of a consolidated evaluation methodology. A tool is being developed based on data mining and computational intelligence approaches. It will allow knowledge-based alternative project units scheduling, conditioned to previously selected specific footprint values and environmental indicators. This decision support system (DSS), based on multi-criteria and multi-objective intelligent optimization algorithms, will help to reduce carbon and water footprints of rail infrastructure construction projects by around 10% and 5%, respectively.
   Tests are going to be performed on two real high speed railway construction projects. That way, a global search procedure provides an analysis of the best alternatives in the scheduling and execution of the project units and their environmental impact offering a front of solutions displaying different trade-off amongst several 'footprints'. Results will allow the development of a series of environmental impact indicators, which will support rail infrastructure construction companies becoming more sustainable and efficient by minimizing their environmental impact.

AB Purpose The environmental impacts (EIs) of the global pig production sector are expected to increase with increasing global pork demand. Although the pig breeding industry has made significant progress over the last decades in reducing its EI, previous work has been unable to differentiate between the improvements made through management improvements from those caused by genetic change. Our study investigates the effect of altering genetic components of individual traits on the EI of pig systems. Methods An LCA model, with a functional unit of 1 kg live weight pig, was built simulating an intensive pig production system; inputs of feed and outputs of manure were adjusted according to genetic performance traits. Feed intake was simulated with an animal energy requirement model. A correlation matrix of the genetic variance and correlations of traits was pooled from data on commercial pig populations in the literature. Three sensitivity analyses were applied: one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis (OAT) used the genetic standard deviations, clusters-of-traits sensitivity analysis (COT) used the genetic standard deviations and clustering based on correlations, and the sensitivity index (SI) applied the full correlation matrix. Five EI categories were considered: global warming potential, terrestrial acidification potential, freshwater eutrophication potential, land use, and fossil resource scarcity. Results and discussion The different EI categories showed similar behaviour for each trait in the sensitivity analyses. OAT showed up to 18% change in EI relative to baseline for energy maintenance and around 3% change in EI relative to baseline for most other traits. COT grouped traits into a grower/finisher cluster (up to 17% change relative to baseline), a reproductive cluster (up to 7% change relative to baseline), and a sow robustness cluster (up to 2% change relative to baseline), all clusters including negative correlations between traits. By including genetic correlations, the SI went from being influenced by maintenance, and finisher and gilt growth rate into solely being dominated by maintenancen and protein-to-lipid ratio responsible for above 0.8 and 0.35 of the variance in EI respectively. Conclusions We developed a novel methodology for evaluating EIs of changes in correlated genetic traits in pigs. We found it was essential to include correlations in the sensitivity analysis, since the local and global sensitivity analyses were not affected to the same extend by the same traits. Further, we found that finisher growth rate, body protein-to-lipid ratio, and energy maintenance could be important in reducing EI, but mortalities and sow robustness had little effect.

AB It is challenging to develop accurate models for heavy construction equipment residual value prediction using conventional approaches. This article proposes three Machine Learning-based methods of Modified Decision Tree (MDT), LightGBM, and XGBoost regressions to predict construction equipment's residual value. Supervised machine learning algorithms were used to comprehensively investigate the datasets throughout training, testing, modeling, and cross-validation processes. Four performance metrics (i.e., MAE, MSE, MAPE, and R2) were used to measure and compare the algorithms' accuracy. Based on the coefficient of determination results, the MDT algorithm has the highest prediction accuracy of 0.9284, versus the LightGBM with an accuracy of 0.8765, followed by XGBoost, obtaining an accuracy of 0.8493. The MDT can be used as a managerial decision support tool for equipment sellers, buyers, and owners to perform equipment life cycle analysis and take equipment selling, purchasing, overhauling, repairing, disposing, and replacing decisions. Thus, this study motivates machine learning's potential to help advancing automation as a coherent field of research within the construction industry.

AB This investigation develops a model to predict household transportation life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and identifies the strongest determinants of these emissions. The impact of many variables on household transportation GHG emissions is examined. Ten machine learning methods are used for modeling and prediction. Shapley additive explanation is then applied detect the relative influence of variables on household GHG emissions. Partial dependency plots are also employed to capture the direction of influence of top variables on household GHG emissions. Further analyses suggest that considering tail-pipe emissions rather than life-cycle emissions leads to underestimating the GHG emissions by roughly 20%. Replacing all gasoline vehicles with electric vehicles would reduce GHG emissions in Montreal by 57%. Then, the modal shifts required to meet the Government of Canada's goals for transportation GHGs are determined. Finally, a scenario analysis is applied, and a number of GHG emission scenarios are presented.

AB Sugarcane cultivation requires correct fertilizer rates. However, when nutrients are not available, or there is over-fertilization, the yields are significantly reduced and the environmental burden increase. In this study, it is proposed a decision support system (DSS) for the correct NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) fertilization. The DSS consists of two fuzzy models; the edaphic condition model (EDC-M) and the NPK fertilization model (NPK-M). The DSS using parameters from soil analysis and is based on the experience of two groups of experts to avoid the bias to the reality of a single group of professionals. The results of the DSS are compared with the results of soil analysis and those of the group of experts. One hundred and sixty tests were developed in the NPK-M. The N rate showsR(2)=0.981 for the DSS andR(2)=0.963 for soil analyzes. The P rate showsR(2)=0.9702 for the DSS andR(2)=0.9183 for the soil analyzes. The K rate showsR(2)=0.9691 for the DSS andR(2)=0.9663 for the soil analyzes. Environmental results indicate that the estimated rates with the DSS do reduce the environmental impact on the tests performed.

AB This paper presents a bibliometric analysis examining dynamic life cycle (LC) studies in the building sector from 2007 to 2024, focusing on works that integrate or apply three key methods: Building Information Modelling (BIM), Machine Learning (ML), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). By analysing a broad range of publications from the Web of Science database and Scopus database, we investigate publication trends and impacts, collaboration patterns, and highly cited work. A total of 549 core articles were identified within the study scope, with 3,136 additional records included for a sensitivity analysis. Our findings indicate that BIM-LC is the most prevalent, with extensive international collaborations. ML-LC, although a newer area, shows a rapid growth rate and potential in this area. GIS-LC shows steady contributions reflecting ongoing relevance to spatial sustainability. We also propose a conceptual framework illustrating how BIM, ML, and GIS can enhance dynamic LC studies in buildings, highlighting opportunities for practical application, such as standardised dynamic data and workflows, advanced algorithms, pilot experiments and real-world validation. By providing insights into bibliometric analysis and a conceptual framework, this review advances understanding of dynamic LC studies in the building sector.

AB In the last few years, Industrial Information Integration Engineering (IIIE) has attracted much attention by the information and communications technology (ICT) community. However, despite of the dynamic nature of this research area, a systematic and extensive review of recent research on IIIE is unavailable. Accordingly, this study conducts an intensive literature review on IIIE and presents an overview of IIIE's content, scope and findings, and potential research opportunities by examining existing literatures from 2006 to 2015 in all databases within Web of Science. Altogether, 497 papers related to IIIE are grouped into 37 research categories and reviewed. The results add knowledge to the existing ones by answering what the current level of development on IIIE is and what the potential future research directions of IIIE are. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Machine learning (ML)-guided polymer design and synthesis will enable the next-generation membrane material discovery for CO2 capture. Herein, ML is leveraged to establish a structure-performance relationship for the eco-friendly poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) membrane and guide its design for high-efficacy CO2/N-2 separation. Through a rational fragment representation method and knowledge sharing across membranes fabricated by different methods, the precise prediction of CO2/N-2 separation performance for PEO membranes with high Pearson correlation coefficients (0.973 for permeability and 0.875 for selectivity) despite data scarcity is demonstrated. Expertise knowledge and external monomer databases are then utilized in a human-in-the-loop workflow to effectively explore high-performance PEO membranes in the design space. Several discovered thermally crosslinked PEO membranes achieve CO2/N-2 separation performances close to the 2019 Robeson upper bound, which are promising for practical large-scale carbon capture applications. Model interpretation techniques are employed to provide data-driven insights into the design of PEO membranes for high-efficacy CO2/N-2 separation. Further life cycle assessment results reveal the outstanding advantage of discovered PEO membranes in terms of environmental friendliness. The work highlights the enormous potential of ML in expediting the discovery of high-performance carbon capture membrane materials.

AB Estimates of the land area occupied by wind energy differ by orders of magnitude due to data scarcity and inconsistent methodology. We developed a method that combines machine learning-based imagery analysis and geographic information systems and examined the land area of 318 wind farms (15,871 turbines) in the U.S. portion of the Western Interconnection. We found that prior land use and human modification in the project area are critical for land-use efficiency and land transformation of wind projects. Projects developed in areas with little human modification have a land-use efficiency of 63.8 +/- 8.9 W/m(2 )(mean +/- 95% confidence interval) and a land transformation of 0.24 +/- 0.07 m(2)/MWh, while values for projects in areas with high human modification are 447 +/- 49.4 W/m(2) and 0.05 +/- 0.01 m(2)/MWh, respectively. We show that land resources for wind can be quantified consistently with our replicable method, a method that obviates >99% of the workload using machine learning. To quantify the peripheral impact of a turbine, buffered geometry can be used as a proxy for measuring land resources and metrics when a large enough impact radius is assumed (e.g., >4 times the rotor diameter). Our analysis provides a necessary first step toward regionalized impact assessment and improved comparisons of energy alternatives.

AB Designers are challenged to create sustainable products that succeed in the marketplace, often relying on life cycle analyses to identify engineered sustainable features while neglecting perceived-as-sustainable (PAS) features. PAS features may not contribute to engineered sustainability but are identified by customers as sustainable. In previous papers, we proposed methods for extracting PAS features from online reviews using machine learning techniques and validating them using collage placement techniques. We demonstrated our methods using French presses (and other products). In this paper, we combined design and marketing approaches to test previously extracted PAS features in terms of purchasing products that include PAS features, as compared to others that do not. We built a simulated Amazon shopping experience using incentive alignment and constructed a within-subject, fractional factorial design with a variety of product features and physical appearances. We collected data on purchase intent, willingness to pay, and sustainability rating. We found that participants opted to purchase products with PAS features more often than products with features that are not PAS, termed "dummy" features. Participants also indicated they were willing to pay more for products with PAS features and rated those products as more sustainable, despite the features not contributing to engineered sustainability. Our findings demonstrate the potential value of identifying and including PAS features in sustainable products and a new application for shopping simulation experiments in design research. We recommend that sustainable designers include both engineered and PAS features in sustainable products to align with customer needs, drive purchasing decisions, and potentially increase profitability.

AB Wheat is considered as one of the most important strategic crops in Iran, and Iran agricultural ministry has some special plans to encourage farmers to cultivate this crop, so that farmers are willing to cultivate this crop through the country. The previous studies carried out by researchers in Iran showed that the energy consumption in cultivation of this crop is not efficient and there is a high degree of inefficiency in wheat cultivation in Iran. Also, wheat cultivation in Iran is responsible for a high amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In order to differentiate between efficient and inefficient farms, a c-means fuzzy clustering model has been developed and the surveyed wheat farms have been clustered based on three features, i.e. GHG emission, energy ratio and benefit cost ratio. The results showed that the farms which were selected as cluster 2 had the best performance where the total input energy and total GHG were calculated as 38,826.9 MJ per ha and 3185 kgCO(2,eq) per tonne of crop. In other words, the farms in cluster 2 outperformed cluster 1 and 3 where they performed 34 and 19% better than the two other clusters in terms of energy input and 9 and 27% in CO2 emission per tonne of produced crop. The higher output energy and lower input energy in farms of cluster 2 have caused a better economic performance where the benefit cost ratio was calculated as 1.9. The results of this study demonstrate the successful application of fuzzy clustering approach for better use of energy in cropping systems which can lead to a better environmental and economic performance.

AB The contamination of aluminium streams during the different life cycle stages by alloy mixing and/or accumulation of foreign elements, in combination with the limited melt purification options during remelting, represents an important limiting factor in recycling. Consequently, in secondary aluminium production, primary aluminium is used to dilute the concentration of the residual elements, and alloying elements are added to adjust the composition to the target alloy specifications. However, adding elements, for which their refinement in a subsequent recycling step is problematic, results in permanent down-cycling or 'quality losses'. Hence, it is crucial to more efficiently control the composition of the metal streams prior to remelting. This article focuses on the aluminium cascade recycling chain and presents a Monte Carlo-based decision-support tool aiming to: i) identify all feasible clustering solutions per case based on input/output analysis; ii) quantify their environmental effect, and analyze the tradeoffs; iii) consider scrap composition uncertainty/variability. Results reveal that primary resource additions can be minimized by optimizing metal sorting, and thus closing the recycling loop more effectively. Case studies are presented to illustrate the different functions of the tool, including examination of the Pareto front, and evaluation of the 'recyclability' of a scrap stream or a sorting solution into different alloy systems.

AB Science foresight comprises a range of methods to analyze past, present and expected research trends, and uses this information to predict the future status of different fields of science and technology. With the ability to identify high-potential development directions, science foresight can be a useful tool to support the management and planning of future research activities. Science foresight analysts can choose from a rather large variety of approaches. There is, however, relatively little information about how the various approaches can be applied in an effective way. This paper describes a three-step methodological framework for science foresight on the basis of published research papers, consisting of (i) life-cycle analysis, (ii) text mining and (iii) knowledge gap identification by means of automated clustering. The three steps are connected using the research methodology of the research papers, as identified by text mining. The potential of combining these three steps in one frame worlds illustrated by analyzing scientific literature on wind catchers; a natural ventilation concept which has received considerable attention from academia, but with quite low application in practice. The knowledge gaps that are identified show that the automated foresight analysis is indeed able to find uncharted research areas. Results from a sensitivity analysis further show the importance of using full-texts for text mining instead of only title, keywords and abstract. The paper concludes with a reflection on the methodological framework, and gives directions for its intended use in future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Thorough accounting of the climate change impacts of natural gas is crucial to guide the energy transition towards climate change mitigation, as even decarbonization roadmaps project continued natural gas use into the future. The climate change impacts of natural gas extraction have not previously been assessed at the well pad level, accounting for a multitude of geospatial differences between individual pads. Well pads constructed across a varied landscape lead to a range of well pad areas, earth flattening needs, well pad lifetimes, total gas production, and direct land use change (DLUC) effects such as loss of original biomass, soil organic carbon loss, change in net primary productivity, and altering the surface albedo of the site. Using existing well pad data, machine learning techniques, and satellite imagery, the spatial extents of thousands of well pads in New Mexico were delineated for site-specific data collection. A parametric life cycle assessment (LCA) model of natural gas-producing well pads was developed to integrate geospatial differences and DLUC effects, yielding scenario analysis results for each identified well pad. The DLUC effects contributed a median of 14.4% and a maximum of 59.0% to natural gas extraction carbon footprints. The use of well pad-level data revealed that the carbon footprint of natural gas extraction ranges across orders of magnitude, from 0.016 to 46.4 g CO2eq per MJ. The results highlight the need to quantify the climate change impacts of establishing a well pad and extracting natural gas case-by-case, with geographically specific data, to guide new installations towards lower emissions.

AB In Anbetracht der erheblichen Umweltauswirkungen des Bauwesens wird die Analyse und v. a. Optimierung der Nachhaltigkeit von Strukturen unter Beibehaltung des etablierten Zuverlassigkeitsniveaus immer wichtiger. Im Hochbausektor existieren erste Werkzeuge zur Lebenszyklusanalyse, diese sind jedoch nicht direkt ubertragbar auf Bruckentragwerke. Dieser Beitrag fasst die wesentlichen Ansatze und Ergebnisse von aktuellen Forschungsprojekten der Autoren an der ETH zusammen und erlautert insbesondere einen neuen Deep-Learning-basierten Ansatz zur Erkundung und Modellierung des Entwurfsraums parametrischer Bruckenmodelle und deren Leistungsbewertungen und veranschaulicht die Anwendung fur eine Mehrzieloptimierung von Stahlbetonrahmenbrucken. Zunachst werden Daten unter Verwendung eines parametrischen Bruckenmodells sowie der Ankoppelung von Analysesoftware synthetisch generiert und anschliessend bedingte variationelle Autoencoder (CVAE) als Metamodell trainiert. Der CVAE dient im Rahmen des konzeptionellen Bruckenentwurfs als effizienter Co-Pilot sowohl fur die Vorwarts- als auch Ruckwartsanalyse. Die mit dem CVAE durchgefuhrte Sensitivitatsanalyse zeigt Beziehungen zwischen Entwurfsparametern und/oder Leistungskenngrossen sowie Optimierungspotenziale auf. Das hier vorgestellte integrierte Framework besitzt das Potenzial zur Realisierung einer effizienten Bruckenplanung unter insbesondere den Kriterien der Nachhaltigkeit und Tragsicherheit und kann problemlos auf andere parametrische Fragestellungen erweitert werden.
   Parametric modeling and generative deep learning for bridge designGiven the significant environmental impact of the construction industry, the analysis and, above all, optimization of the sustainability of structures while maintaining established levels of reliability are becoming increasingly important. While there are initial tools for life cycle analysis in the building sector, these are not directly transferable to bridge structures. This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach to explore and model the design space of parametric bridge models and their performance evaluations, illustrating its application for multi-objective optimization of reinforced concrete frame bridges. Initially, data is synthetically generated using a parametric bridge model and coupling analysis software, followed by training a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) as a metamodel. In the context of conceptual bridge design, the CVAE serves as an efficient co-pilot for both forward and inverse analysis. The sensitivity analysis performed with the CVAE reveals relationships between design parameters and/or performance metrics, highlighting optimization potentials. The integrated framework presented here has the potential to realize efficient bridge design, particularly focusing on sustainability and structural safety criteria, and can be easily extended to other parametric inquiries.

AB Purpose Learning management systems (LMS) provide detailed information about the processes through event-logs. Process and related data-mining approaches can reveal valuable information from these files to help teachers and executives to monitor and manage their online learning processes. In this regard, the purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the current direction of the literature on educational data mining, and an application framework to analyze the educational data provided by the Moodle LMS. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents a framework to provide a decision support through the approaches existing in process and data-mining fields for analyzing the event-log data gathered from LMS platforms. In this framework, latent class analysis (LCA) and sequential pattern mining approaches were used to understand the general patterns; heuristic and fuzzy approaches were performed for process mining to obtain the workflows and statistics; finally, social-network analysis was conducted to discover the collaborations. Findings The analyses conducted in the study give clues for the process performance of the course during a semester by indicating exceptional situations, clarifying the activity flows, understanding the main process flow and revealing the students' interactions. Findings also show that using the preliminary data analyses before process mining steps is also beneficial to understand the general pattern and expose the irregular ones. Originality/value The study highlights the benefits of analyzing event-log files of LMSs to improve the quality of online educational processes through a case study based on Moodle event-logs. The application framework covers preliminary analyses such as LCA before the use of process mining algorithms to reveal the exceptional situations.

AB This research aimed to study the design strategies of abundant existing Energy-Efficient Buildings (EEBs) by analyzing correlations between the Climate Parameters (CPs) and Building Parameters (BPs). A database of near zero energy buildings was established and tailored data-mining programs were developed to collect data. Statistical test, data distribution visualization, and correlation analysis were implemented using customized statistical metrics programs to reveal the trends, preferences and potentials of the design strategies summarized as follows: (1) Climate-adaptable design of exterior form was paid more attention to than envelope system, and the design optimization focused on the adjustment of building shape coefficients. (2) The humidity and average high temperature were the most influential factors. (3) The design strategy of envelope system focused on adapting to cold climates, while hot climates were little considered. (4) For EEBs in China, correlations between the CPs and BPs were higher than buildings in the other countries. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Scope 3 emissions: Data quality and machine learning prediction accuracy
SO PLOS CLIMATE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARBON FOOTPRINT
AB Investors' sophistication on climate risk is increasing and as part of this they require high-quality and comprehensive Scope 3 emissions data. Accordingly, we investigate Scope 3 emissions data divergence (across different providers), composition (which Scope 3 categories are reported) and whether machine-learning models can be used to predict Scope 3 emissions for non-reporting firms. We find considerable divergence in the aggregated Scope 3 emissions values from three of the largest data providers (Bloomberg, Refinitiv Eikon, and ISS). The divergence is largest for ISS, as it replaces reported Scope 3 emissions with estimates from its economic input-output and life cycle assessment modelling. With respect to the composition of Scope 3 emissions, firms generally report incomplete composition, yet they are reporting more categories over time. There is a persistent contrast between relevance and completeness in the composition of Scope 3 emissions across sectors, with low materiality categories such as travel emissions being reported more frequently than typically high materiality ones, such as the use of products and processing of sold products. Finally, machine learning algorithms can improve the prediction accuracy of the aggregated Scope 3 emissions by up to 6% and up to 25% when each category is estimated individually and aggregated into total Scope 3 emissions. However, absolute prediction performance is low even with the best models, with the accuracy of estimates primarily limited by low observations in specific Scope 3 categories. We conclude that investors should be cognizant of Scope 3 emissions data divergence, incomplete reporting of Scope 3 categories, and that predictions for non-reporting firms have high absolute errors even when using machine learning models. For both reported and estimated data, caveat emptor applies.

AB Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is an innovative nitrogen removal process that is widely used in wastewater treatment due to its energy-saving potential and ability to reduce carbon emissions. However, research on the application of anammox in full-scale industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is limited, and its environmental impacts are yet to be fully understood. This study evaluates the performance and environmental burdens of one-stage partial nitritation and anammox (PN/A) in a full-scale WWTP treating coal chemical wastewater, with different demonstration periods. Compared with conventional nitrification-denitrification, the energy footprint and carbon footprint of the PN/A process were significantly lower and effluent quality was improved. Based on the four-quadrant clustering method, the overall performance of the studied WWTP achieved the greatest synergy during the stable operation period. Life cycle assessment has shown that the PN/A process significantly reduces the system's contribution to environmental indicators. According to the sensitivity analysis, the fluctuations in energy consumption and chemical usage have significant environmental impacts, with differential sensitivity in the environmental impacts of two demonstration periods. Therefore, considering the specific situation of the WWTPs, optimizing the parameters/indicators most sensitive to environmental impact is essential to reducing environmental loads. Importantly, this work demonstrated that PN/A can improve the operational performance of full-scale industrial WWTPs with lower environmental burdens, providing valuable guidance for the development of sustainable wastewater treatment processes.

AB Digital technologies (DTs), such as the Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, or blockchain, are considered as enablers for a more sustainable and circular economy. So far, literature on these topics has mostly focused on specific DTs and subareas of sustainable product management (SPM). The aim of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive overview of current and potential examples of DT applications in SPM (e.g., product design/assessment, supply chain management, and business models). The collected examples (n = 146) were analyzed based on a systematic literature review, using quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Deductive and inductive analyses of the examples revealed the potential of DTs in terms of their usability along the product life cycle, their role as enablers for circular economy strategies and in specific SPM activities. DT application often entails only incremental improvements, for example, increased efficiency of existing processes, with more radical forms of improvement remaining relatively scarce. There is clear room for greater adoption and optimization of DTs, in various areas of SPM, so as to accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable and circular economy.

AB With the increased demand for bio-based products and the rapid development of biomanufacturing technologies, biocatalytic reactions including microorganisms and enzyme based, have become promising approaches. Prior to the scale-up of production process, environmental and economic feasibility analysis are essential for the development of a sustainable and intelligent bioeconomy in the context of industry 4.0. To achieve these goals, process simulation supports system optimization, improves energy and resource utilization efficiencies, and supports digital bioprocessing. However, due to the insufficient understanding of cellular metabolism and interaction mechanisms, there is still a lack of rational and transparent simulation tools to efficiently simulate, control, and optimize microbial/enzymatic reaction processes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop frameworks that integrate kinetic modeling, process simulation, and sustainability analysis for bioreaction simulations and their optimization. This review summarizes and compares the advantages and disadvantages of different process simulation software and models in simulating biocatalytic processes, identifies the limitations of traditional reaction kinetics models, and proposes the requirement of simulations close to real reactions. In addition, we explore the current state of kinetic modeling at the microscopic scale and how process simulation can be linked to kinetic models of cellular metabolism and computational fluid dynamics modeling. Finally, this review discusses the requirement of sensitivity analysis and how machine learning can assist with optimization of simulations to improve energy efficiency and product yields from techno-economic and life cycle assessment perspectives.

AB Solid waste management (SWM) is critical for the sustainable development of the global economy and society, and it should involve the whole life cycle process of waste generation and treatment. Bibliometric and scientific knowledge mapping was applied in this study to systematically review 4239 published papers (1991-2022) in the Web of Science (WOS) core database to obtain an overview of the current knowledge network and the status of waste management research, as well as summarizing the hotspots and frontiers for future research. The results show that: (1) Since the 21st century, SWM research has received extensive attention. During the study period, the number of publications increasing from 7 to 552 per year over the course of the century. An important turning point was reached in 2015, which was followed by a rapid increase in the number of articles published, reaching a peak in 2021. (2) Well known universities in China and around the world were the main sites of knowledge generation, and the cooperative research networks between these institutions resulted in numerous publications. However, international cooperation in this field was still insufficient. (3) Solid waste management research is an interdisciplinary and diversified field, among which integrated waste management and environmental economic assessment, impact mechanisms and residents' behavior, and environmental change and sustainable development were the main research topics. (4) Solid waste management research could be organized into 30 clusters, which were further classified into initial, development, and leapfrog stages based on a timeline analysis of the literature co-citation network. Combining the keyword burst detection results and research hotspots, research frontiers were summarized for four periods, which could be used to describe the phase upgrade of SWM research. Finally, future research directions were proposed in terms of their perspectives, content, methods, and context, including SWM based on the "order-emotion" framework; consideration of multi-stakeholder games; adoption of new paradigms (e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence); and consideration of social and environmental changes and externality costs to build a healthier and more sustainable integrated management system.

AB According to databases such as CONCAWE and PHMSA, corrosion failures of onshore pipelines accounted for about 16% of the overall number of incidents among 2004 to 2011. Therefore, corrosion monitoring has become a major objective within the oil industry. The most popular technique used for this purpose is the In-Line Inspection (ILI), which is used to determine overall pipeline status (e.g., inner and outer condition of the pipe and wall thickness). It is widely used for risk management with standards such as ASMEB31G or API579-1/ASME FFS-1. However, these approaches do not take into account the uncertainty associated with ILI inspection tools (e.g., MFL and UT). Several investigations have been conducted to reduce the noise generated and to accurately measure metal losses. However, there are still important deficiencies in evaluating both the spatial and the time-dependent variability of damage. This work seeks to use data obtained from ILI to better support risk-based decision making. The proposed approach uses corrosion growth models to estimate the remaining life of the pipeline based on mechanistic models (e.g., pressure failure criteria). This information, combined with pattern recognition techniques, clustering and reliability concepts, is then used to obtain base failure probabilities. Actual data from two ILI measurements was used to validate the model. The results show that by using statistical clustering of data, the failure probability may actually increases by 10% in comparison with the corresponding defects evaluated individually. This result have an important impact on any decision regarding life-cycle analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Saffron is one of the most expensive agricultural crops in the world which needs to be clearly monitored in the view of energy balance and carbon footprint in the production stage. Iran is the leading countries in saffron production and now accounts for approximately 60% of the world total production. As the biggest producer of saffron, analyzing the energy and carbon balance would help to produce this crop more economically and environmentally friendly. In the present study, the saffron cultivation in Southern Khorasan, a province in the east of Iran was taken into consideration and this cultivation was evaluated in terms of energy balance and carbon footprint. The evaluation was performed based on the data derived from whole life cycle of this crop i.e., a 6 year period. The assessment of energy balance demonstrated that on average, the total input energy consumed was 99,236 MJ ha(-1). More specifically, the average of energy indices i.e. energy ratio, energy productivity, and net energy were calculated 0.0044, 0.0003 kg MJ(-1), and -98,818.5 MJ ha(-1), respectively. The results clearly revealed that Nitrogen based fertilizers, farmyard manure and Phosphor based fertilizers dominated the total energy consumption meaning that their consumption management need to be given a priority. The total greenhouse gas emissions in saffron production was calculated on 10,897 kg CO2eq ha(-1) which showed a high degree of mismanagement in farm practices in the region meaning that without considerable reduction in saffron yield energy saving can be achieved.

AB Arising the Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) concept in Europe, the solar district heating systems (SDHS) present a potential solution to meet the buildings sector's European energy performance directive. Nevertheless, current practices face several technological and economical barriers to ensure service quality. In this context, our work presents a sustainability analysis (technical, economic, environmental, and social) for SDHS integration in the residential sector to meet the NZEB and positive energy building goals. This paper proposes an application of a machine learning model incorporating multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision making to facilitate a sustainability index for the decision-making stakeholders and policymakers. The proposed analysis application is illustrated through retrofitted residential communities with building energy rating (D) at different sizes (10, 25, 50,100, and 500 houses) located in Emmen (Netherlands) and compared to a standard decentralized heat pump. The optimization results show the ability of SDHS to provide a solar fraction up to 95% in the community of 500 houses. Furthermore, achieving a NZEB status is only approved economically from a community size of 100 houses with a life cycle cost of 41 V/m2 and a payback period of 25 years. These results align with a substantial environmental and social improvement of 78.2% and 29.7%, respectively, compared to the decentralized heat pump. Overall, this study provides policy decision making with an evaluation for positive energy communities and suggests the SDHS integration to meet the global sustainability goals. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB In longitudinal studies, outcomes are measured repeatedly over time and it is common that not all the patients will be measured throughout the study. For example patients can be lost to follow-up (monotone missingness) or miss one or more visits (non-monotone missingness); hence there are missing outcomes. In the longitudinal setting, we often assume the missingness is related to the unobserved data, which is non-ignorable. Pattern-mixture models (PMM) analyze the joint distribution of outcome and patterns of missingness in longitudinal data with non-ignorable non-monotone missingness. Existing methods employ PMM and impute the unobserved outcomes using the distribution of observed outcomes, conditioned on missing patterns. We extend the existing methods using latent class analysis (LCA) and a shared-parameter PMM. The LCA groups patterns of missingness with similar features and the shared-parameter PMM allows a subset of parameters to be different between latent classes when fitting a model. We also propose a method for imputation using distribution of observed data conditioning on latent class. Our model improves existing methods by accommodating data with small sample size. In a simulation study our estimator had smaller mean squared error than existing methods. Our methodology is applied to data from a phase II clinical trial that studies quality of life of patients with prostate cancer receiving radiation therapy.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Objective: Laryngoscopy, essential for diagnosing laryngeal cancer (LCA), faces challenges due to high inter-observer variability and the reliance on endoscopist expertise. Distinguishing precancerous from early- stage cancerous lesions is particularly challenging, even for experienced practitioners, given their similar appearances. This study aims to enhance laryngoscopic image analysis to improve early screening/detection of cancer or precancerous conditions. Methods: We propose MedFormer, a laryngeal cancer classification method based on the Vision Transformer (ViT). To address data scarcity, MedFormer employs a customized transfer learning approach that leverages the representational power of pre-trained transformers. This method enables robust out-of-domain generalization by fine-tuning a minimal set of additional parameters. Results: MedFormer exhibits sensitivity-specificity values of 98%-89% for identifying precancerous lesions (leukoplakia) and 89%-97% for detecting cancer, surpassing CNN counterparts significantly. Additionally, when compared to the two selected ViT-based models, MedFormer also demonstrates superior performance. It also outperforms physician visual evaluations (PVE) in certain scenarios and matches PVE performance in all cases. Visualizations using class activation maps (CAM) and deformable patches demonstrate MedFormer's interpretability, aiding clinicians in understanding the model's predictions. Conclusion: We highlight the potential of visual transformers in clinical laryngoscopic assessments, presenting MedFormer as an effective method for the early detection of laryngeal cancer.

AB With the rapid development of new infrastructure in China, the demand for copper has increased significantly. In 2021, copper consumption in this sector accounted for 9.1% of China's total consumption, becoming a new driving force for copper demand. This study analyzed copper flow characteristics and primary driving factors in China's new infrastructure sectors using the material flow analysis method, quantified the environmental loads of the metabolic processes, and predicted copper demand in the new infrastructure sectors by 2030 through scenario analysis. The primary conclusions drawn are as follows: In 2021, copper consumption in new infrastructure sectors was 1,225,700 tons, with the rail transportation sector accounting for 59.6% and the artificial intelligence sector accounting for 0.6%. The rail transportation sector had the largest total environmental load, with carbon emissions of approximately 3,513,372 tons. From the perspective of tons of copper products, the 5G sector had the highest environmental load, while the big data centers had the lowest. In the seven sectors of new infrastructure, the environmental load contribution rates across the four stages showed little variation, with their proportions being 49.0, 29.8, 15.8, and 5.4%, respectively. Recycling of discarded copper products can effectively reduce industrial energy consumption and carbon emissions. Under the three scenarios set in this study, the copper demand in the new infrastructure sector by 2030 will be 3.856, 3.233, and 2.625 million tons, respectively. Using wind energy to replace coal in copper production can reduce carbon emissions by approximately 43.2%.

AB Background: Recent studies have shown that anticoagulant therapy has heterogeneous treatment effects on patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC).Aims: To identify the latent phenotypes of patients with SIC. Study design: Retrospective cohort study.Methods: We obtained data of patients with SIC from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. SIC subphenotypes were identified by latent class analysis (LCA) and K-means clustering. Clinical and laboratory variables were obtained in patients who met the diagnostic criteria for SIC. The baseline characteristics of the patients and the association between the heterogeneity of anticoagulant therapy and clinical outcomes (28-day and in-hospital mortality) were compared between the subphenotypes.Results: We identified 4,993 patients with SIC. The LCA and K-means clustering analysis robustly identified three subphenotypes of SIC. Class 1 patients (n = 1,808) had the lowest blood cell counts (leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets). Class 2 patients (n = 1,157) had severe coagulopathy with a high prothrombin time and international normalized ratio, multiple-organ dysfunction, high lactate, sequential organ failure assessment score, and mortality. Class 3 (n = 2,028) were older, had more comorbidities, a higher fibrinogen concentration, and lower plasma and platelet infusion rates. After variable adjustments, heparin therapy reduced the 28-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 0.30-0.49, p < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (OR 0.42, 0.33-0.53, p < 0.001) only in class 2.Conclusion: Three SIC subphenotypes were defined using clinical findings and laboratory variables. The effects of heparin treatment differ between the subphenotypes. This finding will facilitate the identification of target patients with SIC who should receive anticoagulant therapy.

AB Nowadays, battery design must be considered a multi-disciplinary activity focused on product sustainability in terms of environmental impacts and cost. The paper reviews the design tools and methods in the context of Li-ion battery packs. The discussion focuses on different aspects, from thermal analysis to management and safety. The paper aims to investigate what has been achieved in the last twenty years to understand current and future trends when designing battery packs. The goal is to analyze the methods for defining the battery pack's layout and structure using tools for modeling, simulations, life cycle analysis, optimization, and machine learning. The target concerns electric and hybrid vehicles and energy storage systems in general. The paper makes an original classification of past works defining seven levels of design approaches for battery packs. The final discussion analyzes the correlation between the changes in the design methods and the increasing demand for battery packs. The outcome of this paper allows the reader to analyze the evolutions of the design methods and practices in battery packs and to understand future developments.

AB The conceptual design decisions have the largest influence on a building project's safety, value, and environmental impact; hence they are commonly assigned to a "senior engineer'' to make use of his/her experience. However, the senior engineers can be biased towards solutions inside their area of expertise, which often prevents them from finding the best solutions among alternatives that must consider complex inter-related, and multi-disciplinary parameters. The engineering community could benefit from a rapid and high-quality decision-making method or tool to increase the speed and quality of its high-impact design choices. There are valuable studies in the literature exploiting Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the structural design process; however, most of them focus on the final design stage (e.g., Building Information Modeling), and the rest requires an existing project database (e.g., architectural drawings, already decided material types) to propose a small number of initial design alternatives. In this article, we present the development and validation of a genetic algorithm tool based on Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) that can be used to analyse a wide range of safe, economical and low-CO2 options for the conceptual design of buildings. The design space starts from a design brief (with only the information about the site characteristics and project objectives). The solutions are explored with the material, grid size, floor type, lateral resistance, and foundation system variables. In a short computational time (< 2 min per run), users are provided with a Pareto graph of a large set of feasible solutions (in terms of cost, embodied CO2 emissions and free space) that an engineer would not be typically able to evaluate within a traditional conceptual design process. For future applications, the methodology presented in this paper is flexible to include more engineering materials (e.g., timber, masonry, structural glass), complex architectural forms and merge other disciplines in decision making (e.g., building physics construction management, fire safety).

AB Purpose - The phenomenon of traffic crash under-reporting has been extensively documented in terms of its extent, but not equally analysed in terms of its reasons. As police distrust has been recently identified as a major reason for crash under-reporting, the purpose of this paper is to look at the police service quality for handling the reporting of traffic crashes.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study introduces a novel approach to evaluate service quality that combines multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) with latent class analysis (LCA). Moreover, this study presents the design of a web-based survey on the basis of the SERVQUAL approach to detecting strengths, opportunities and threats with crash reporting to the police at a strategic level. Transportation stakeholders (e.g. researchers, authorities, consultants, NGO representatives, suppliers) with an interest in traffic safety in Denmark participated in the survey that yielded 86 complete responses.
   Findings - The novel approach was successfully applied and its implementation demonstrated the usefulness of the tool even in countries with a high police service. Results showed that the participating stakeholders perceived human factors as more important than physical factors in order to increase the crash reporting, with responsiveness as the most important and tangibles as the least important dimensions. Nevertheless, most stakeholders viewed a mixture of human and physical factors as crucial to increase crash reporting rates.
   Originality/value - This study advances the knowledge about police service quality with a novel expert-based decision support tool based on SERVQUAL, MCDA and LCA, demonstrates its applicability in countries with a high-police service, and opportunities and barriers for increasing the crash reporting rate.

AB With the outbreak and ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, a wave of post-COVID-19 zeitgeist has emerged worldwide. From the perspective of fashion trends, an increasing number of consumers are demanding higher standards of health, environmental friendliness, and sustainability. Over the past 10 years, the integration of technology in clothing has facilitated continuous updates in both functionality and aesthetics. This article aims to explore the relationship between clothing technology and sustainable fashion in the post-COVID-19 era, seeking to enhance the development and innovation of sustainable fashion through the empowerment of clothing technology. This study conducts extensive research on the literature and online case studies, categorizing empowered sustainable fashion technology design cases into six major categories and four directional themes. It introduces an innovative sustainable fashion design assessment model, PCBS (Product, Customer, Business, Society). Subsequently, the knowledge framework is applied in design practice alongside consumer research to validate the system's usability. Furthermore, this research synthesizes and summarizes the methods through which fashion technology can support sustainable fashion in the post-pandemic era. Designers and practitioners can reference these insights for more advanced sustainable design initiatives, thereby promoting a lower-carbon and environmentally friendly system that drives global innovation and development in a sustainable society.

AB The urgency of addressing climate change has amplified the need for sustainable manufacturing practices. This review explores the integration of carbon footprint management and energy efficiency strategies within Industry 4.0 technologies and ERP systems, emphasizing their role in achieving environmental sustainability. Despite the increasing interest in these domains, the literature reveals critical gaps, particularly in the application of Industry 4.0 technologies-such as IoT, big data analytics, and AI-for effective carbon management and sustainable manufacturing. Furthermore, the limited exploration of ERP systems in tracking, analyzing, and optimizing carbon emissions across supply chains highlights another under-researched area. This paper systematically reviews recent advancements, methodologies, and implementation challenges, categorizing findings under energy efficiency strategies, green supply chain management, and digital transformation for carbon reduction. The study identifies opportunities for real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and cross-sector collaborations while addressing obstacles such as high initial costs, data integration complexities, and the lack of regulatory frameworks. By bridging these research gaps, this paper contributes a comprehensive understanding of how Industry 4.0 technologies and ERP systems can transform carbon footprint management, providing actionable insights for academia, policymakers, and industry practitioners aiming to align with global sustainability goals.

AB This study aimed to explore attentional patterns among children with inattentive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD-I) and children with typical development (TD), using a latent class analysis (LCA). Patterns of brain connectivity were also explored. The sample comprised 29 ADHD-I and 29 TD matched children. An LCA was conducted to reclassify subjects according to their attentional performance, considering cognitive measures of attention and behavioral symptoms, regardless of group of origin. The new clusters were then compared in respect to brain white matter measurements (extracted from diffusion tensor imaging). Participants were rearranged in 2 new latent classes, according to their performance in an attention task and the results of behavioral scales, resulting in groups with more homogeneous attentional profiles. A comparison of the 2 new classes using the white matter measurements revealed increased fractional anisotropy in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus for the class composed by participants with a higher risk of attentional problems. The findings indicated that it was possible to observe variability regarding neuropsychological profile, accompanied by underpinning neurobiological differences, even among individuals with the same disorder subtype - inattentive ADHD. This specific data-driven clustering analysis may help to enhance understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder's phenotypes.

AB In the current study, an algorithm-based data processing, sizing, optimization, sensitivity analysis and clustering approach (DaSOSaCa) is proposed as an efficient simultaneous solar/wind assessment methodology. Accordingly, data processing is performed to obtain reliable high quality meteorological data among various datasets, which are used for hybrid photovoltaic/wind turbine/storage/converter system optimal design for consequent sites in a large region. The optimal hybrid systems are consequently simulated to meet hourly power demand in various sites. The solar/wind fraction and net present cost of the systems are then used as the technical and economic clustering variables, respectively. The clustering results are finally used as input to obtain novel hybrid solar/wind GIS maps. Iran is selected as the case study to validate the proposed methodology and detail its applicability. Ten minute annual global horizontal radiation, wind speed, and temperature data are analyzed, and the optimal, robust hybrid systems are simulated for various sites in order to classify the country. The generated GIS maps show that Iran can be efficiently clustered into four technical and five economic clusters under optimal conditions. The clustering results prove that Iran is mainly a solar country with approximately 74% solar power fraction under optimum conditions. A macroeconomic evaluation using DaSOSaCa also reveals that the nominal discount rate is recommended to be greater than 20% considering the current economic situation for the renewable energy sector in Iran. An environmental analysis results show that an average 106.68 tonCO(2)-eq/year is produced for such hybrid systems application in Iran during a cradle to grave life cycle. Thus, Iran energy sector can be eminently promoted to an environmentally efficient stage with regard to the proposed classification plan and economic considerations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Promoting the use of public transportation may play a key role in achieving zero-carbon emissions and sustainable development goals. Due to the ability to cut down greenhouse gas emissions, electric buses have emerged as promising alternatives to pave the way for shaping sustainable cities. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the performance of electric buses in terms of their energy consumption, design optimization, and other management, which in turn depends on factors such as type and geometric conditions of the road, driver behavior, etc. The driving cycle is a time series of vehicle speeds that reflects the typical driving pattern of any given region/city. To the best of author's knowledge, no studies have developed driving cycles for Electric buses plying on urban and rural roads in India. For this, on-road trajectory data of approximately 650 km data were collected from electric buses using a VBOX sport device at a frequency of 10 Hz. Collected data were analyzed to characterize the specific driving patterns and segmented the entire data into micro-trips. Then, Patna Electric Bus Driving Cycle (PEBDC) was developed by selecting the representative micro-trips using k-means clustering technique. The developed driving cycle was also compared with international driving cycles, and it was observed that PEBDC is considerably different from selected international bus driving cycles. In comparison with other driving cycles developed for Indian cities, it was observed that buses driving in Patna exhibit relatively lower average speeds and percentage of time involved in acceleration and deceleration activities. The driving cycle developed in this study can be used to compute energy consumption, electricity grid analysis, and economic and life cycle analysis of electric buses.

AB To achieve a win-win solution for pollution reduction in the traditional construction industry and rubbish management, waste oyster shells (WOS) has been widely utilized as construction materials. This study systematically considered the overall potential impacts of different WOS substitutions (WOS fines, WOS sand, WOS gravel) in different cement-based products. The valorization scenarios involved applying WOS substitutions into mortar, brick, and concrete, while the basic scenario focused on the landfilling method. To highlight regional differences, Shanghai, Paris, and Seoul were selected as the primary application environments. Therefore, by considering various perspectives such as substitution types, replacement ratios, application locations, and types of construction products, this study systematically analyzed the environmental performance, mechanical strength, and economic feasibility of all scenarios. Ultimately, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted using the 3E model to identify the optimal solution. The results indicated that the environmental friendliness of WOS products was always superior to the control group, while the pollution contributions of product components can be ranked as: cement production approximate to natural aggregate transportation >> WOS processing and transportation. The environmental friendliness can be further improved by shortening the upstream aggregate transport distance, increasing the cement substitution ratio, and reducing electricity consumption during WOS fines production, as confirmed by AI-aided sensitivity analysis. Moreover, the analysis of economic feasibility and engineering properties demonstrated that the WOS products did not result in significant cost savings and may carry the risk of reduced strength. It can be further enhanced by lowering WOS preprocessing labor costs and incorporating a superplasticizer agent. Finally, the 3E model evaluation of all scenarios across the three regions revealed that the brick with 10 % cement replacement achieved the highest score due to its low environmental impact, high mechanical performance, and most economical production costs. This study provides new insights for decision- making regarding sustainable construction materials.

AB The increasing global importance of climate change has been clearly recognised in the last few years. The building industry contributed to a large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim of identifying the current practices and future research need in this field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB It is currently unknown which attitude-based profiles are associated with symptom checker use for self-triage. We sought to identify, among university students, attitude-based latent classes (population profiles) and the association between latent classes with the future use of symptom checkers for self-triage. Informed by the Technology Acceptance Model and a larger mixed methods study, a cross-sectional survey was developed and administered to students (aged between 18 and 34 years of age) at a University in Ontario. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify attitude-based profiles that exist among the sample while general linear modeling was applied to identify the association between latent classes and future symptom checker use for self-triage. Of the 1,547 students who opened the survey link, 1,365 did not use a symptom checker in the past year and were thus identified as "non-users". After removing missing data (remaining sample = n = 1,305), LCA revealed five attitude-based profiles: tech acceptors, tech rejectors, skeptics, tech seekers, and unsure acceptors. Tech acceptors and tech rejectors were the most and least prevalent classes, respectively. As compared to tech rejectors, tech seekers and unsure acceptors were the latent classes with the highest and lowest odds of future symptom checker use, respectively. After controlling for confounders, the effect of latent classes on symptom checker use remains significant (p-value < .0001) with the odds of future use in tech acceptors being 5.6 times higher than the odds of future symptom checker use in tech rejectors [CI: (3.458, 9.078); p-value < .0001]. Attitudes towards AI and symptom checker functionality result in different population profiles that have different odds of using symptom checkers for self-triage. Identifying a person's or group's membership to a population profile could help in developing and delivering tailored interventions aimed at maximizing use of validated symptom checkers.

AB Paddy straw burning is an entrenched issue in the agricultural system, widely recognized for its adverse environmental and health impacts, particularly in South Asian countries. The revolutionary advancements in nanotechnology have paved the way for innovative solutions by valorizing silica-rich paddy straw (PS) into silica nanoparticles (SiNPs). SiNPs are known for their versatile role in agriculture sectors. Nonetheless, the high fabrication cost of SiNPs has limited its utility. Exploring agro-waste PS as a potential source of SiNPs promises resource efficiency and a sustainable solution towards stubble management. The review sheds light on various modes of synthesis of SiNPs, critically featuring the green synthesis approach using PS. The multifaceted potential of SiNPs in alleviating biotic and abiotic stress and delivering essential components in plants is discussed. Given the challenges of synthesizing well-characterized SiNPs, integrating machine learning in synthesis process and design of slow-release formulations is recommended. The review envisions future research encompassing Sustainable Agriculture Matrix, Sensitivity Analysis, and Life Cycle Assessment to seamlessly integrate SiNPs into agriculture. Under the umbrella of PS management, various laws and policies undertaken by the GOI have been discussed. The valorization of PS is proposed as a lucrative opportunity for entrepreneurship programs by authors. While research on SiNPs in agriculture is advancing, much remains to learn about their mechanisms of action, interactions with plants, soils, toxicity, and potential synergies/trade-offs with other agricultural inputs. Moreover, ensuring affordable access to SiNPs for small-scale farmers and resource-limited regions requires considerable attention. Hence, the review endeavors to capture the attention of stakeholders to embrace a comprehensive approach towards stubble management that will contribute towards SDGs and nurturing a thriving circular bioeconomy.

AB Nowadays, sustainability is one of the critical factors for the success of supply chains in organizations and firms that strive to maintain a competitive edge in the market. In wood industry, due to the need for integrating several business units such as forest entrepreneurs, carriers, pulp and paper mills and sawmills, such industries encounter various difficulties in maintaining effective supply chain collaborations. Literature on wood furniture industry seems to be lagging in terms of research on sustainable supply chain operations. To fill this gap, this study aims at identifying the critical factors that stand as a barrier between manufacturing and environmental sustainability in wood furniture industries. To achieve this aim, an integrated framework based on the triplet of Hierarchical Clustering, Analytical Hierarchy Process and Best-Worst Method has been proposed and implemented in a leading furniture manufacturer in UAE. The results show that waste management is the primary concern when an organization wants to pursue manufacturing environmental sustainability. Resources come in the second place where non-renewable resources should be substituted by renewable ones. The results were supported by a sensitivity analysis which confirms that higher attention should be directed to recycling of wood waste. Findings of this study provide recommendations to managers and decision makers on how to improve the manufacturing environmental sustainability in wood furniture industries to achieve the Triple Base Line (TBL) concept of sustainability and integrate sustainably in industry 4.0 context.

AB This paper involves an analysis to determine appropriate cassava harvest practices and choose a pricing scheme between farmers and factories, cassava yards, and collectors in Thailand. Harvest practices represent all activities from land preparation to harvest. A key decision that governs the amount of resources required during cassava life cycle is the cassava's harvesting age. The harvesting age can be from eight to 18 months in two patterns: fixed age, e.g., harvest every 12 months, and variable age, e.g., harvest at an age between 10 and 14 months. After harvesting, there are two common pricing schemes to consider, which are weight-based and starch-content-based. Factors that affect the two decisions made by Thai farmers at a given time are the market price, which highly varies within a season and between seasons, and yields in terms of weight and starch content, both of which change with cassava's age and/or harvest month. Economic sustainability measure for Thai farmers is the average monthly profit that the farmers gain over cassava harvest cycle under uncertain market price. To handle uncertainties, a simulation model is constructed to imitate cassava planting activities from cultivation to harvest. The purpose is to evaluate various harvesting ages and two pricing schemes under uncertain cassava market prices. Market prices in 15 seasons (2006-2021) are grouped using the k-mean clustering into four price scenarios. As cassava grows in the simulation, the required resources are consumed until the decisions on harvesting time and pricing scheme are made with estimated selling probability under different price scenarios and uncertainty in cassava yield. Through simulation, harvesting age and pricing scheme that are most profitable and robust-to-system-variation are determined. Finally, a guideline for Thai farmers to choose a pricing scheme is developed based on the sensitivity analysis of the simulation model.

AB Aims Chronic heart failure (CHF) has an increasing burden of comorbidities, which affect clinical outcomes. Few studies have focused on the clustering and hierarchical management of patients with CHF based on comorbidity. This study aimed to explore the cluster model of CHF patients based on comorbidities and to verify their relationship with clinical outcomes.
   Methods and results Electronic health records of patients hospitalized with CHF from January 2014 to April 2019 were collected, and 12 common comorbidities were included in the latent class analysis. The Fruchterman-Reingold layout was used to draw the comorbidity network, and analysis of variance was used to compare the weighted degrees among them. The incidence of clinical outcomes among different clusters was presented on Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using the log-rank test, and the hazard ratio was calculated using the Cox proportional risk model. Sensitivity analysis was performed according to the left ventricular ejection fraction. Four different clinical clusters from 4063 total patients were identified: metabolic, ischaemic, high comorbidity burden, and elderly-atrial fibrillation. Compared with the metabolic cluster, patients in the high comorbidity burden cluster had the highest adjusted risk of combined outcome and all-cause mortality {1.67 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.40-1.99] and 2.87 [95% CI, 2.17-3.81], respectively}, followed by the elderly-atrial fibrillation and ischaemic clusters. The adjusted readmission risk of patients with ischaemic, high comorbidity burden, and elderly-atrial fibrillation clusters were 1.35 (95% CI, 1.08-1.68), 1.39 (95% CI, 1.13-1.72), and 1.42 (95% CI, 1.14-1.77), respectively. The comorbidity network analysis found that patients in the high comorbidity burden cluster had more and higher comorbidity correlations than those in other clusters. Sensitivity analysis revealed that patients in the high comorbidity burden cluster had the highest risk of combined outcome and all-cause mortality (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions The difference in adverse outcomes among clusters confirmed the heterogeneity of CHF and the importance of hierarchical management. This study can provide a basis for personalized treatment and management of patients with CHF, and provide a new perspective for clinical decision making.

AB Introduction: Obesity in adults is a problem, particularly when paired with other metabolic abnormalities. Previous research have linked various screening approaches to diabetes, but additional evidence points to the relevance of combining diabetes screening methods with obesity and its effects. This research examined the impact of thyroid hormones (TSHs) and health risk factors (HRFs) in screening for obesity and diabetes in Chinese populations, and whether age can modulate this association.
   Methods: From March to July 2022, the Hefei Community Health Service Center connected with the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University was chosen, and the multi-stage cluster sample approach was utilized to test adults aged 21-90 in each community. Latent category analysis (LCA) was performed to investigate the clustering patterns of HRFs. A one-way ANOVA was used to examine waist circumference (WC), biochemical markers, and general data. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to investigate the relationship between health risk variables and WC.
   Results: A total of 750 individuals without a history of major problems who had a community health physical examination were chosen, with missing data greater than 5% excluded. Finally, 708 samples were included in the study with an effective rate of 94.4%. The average WC was (90.0 +/- 10.33) cm, the prevalence in the >P-75, P-50 similar to P-75, P25 similar to P50, and <= P-25 groups were 24.7%, 18.9%, 28.7% and 27.7%, respectively. The average TSH was (2.76 +/- 2.0) mu IU/mL. Male (beta=1.91), HOMA-IR (beta=0.06), TyG (beta=2.41), SBP (beta=0.08), TG (beta=0.94) and UA (beta=0.03) were more likely to have a higher prevalence of WC level. The analyses revealed significant correlations between HRFs, TSH, age, other metabolic indexes and WC (P < 0.05).
   Discussion: Our findings suggest that the quality of metabolic-related indicators used to successfully decrease diabetes in Chinese individuals with high HRFs levels should be prioritized. Comprehensive indicators might be a useful and practical way for measuring the metabolic evolution of diabetes level levels.
